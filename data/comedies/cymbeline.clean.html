<a NAME=1.1.1>You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods</a>
<a NAME=1.1.2>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers</a>
<a NAME=1.1.3>Still seem as does the king.</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech2><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>

<a NAME=1.1.4>But what's the matter?</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech3><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.5>His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom</a>

<a NAME=1.1.7>That late he married--hath referr'd herself</a>
<a NAME=1.1.8>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.9>Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all</a>
<a NAME=1.1.10>Is outward sorrow; though I think the king</a>
<a NAME=1.1.11>Be touch'd at very heart.</a>
</blockquote>

<a NAME=1.1.12>None but the king?</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech5><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.13>He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.14>That most desired the match; but not a courtier,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.15>Although they wear their faces to the bent</a>
<a NAME=1.1.16>Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not</a>
<a NAME=1.1.17>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech6><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.18>And why so?</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech7><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.19>He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing</a>
<a NAME=1.1.20>Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--</a>
<a NAME=1.1.21>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</a>
<a NAME=1.1.22>And therefore banish'd--is a creature such</a>
<a NAME=1.1.23>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</a>
<a NAME=1.1.24>For one his like, there would be something failing</a>
<a NAME=1.1.25>In him that should compare. I do not think</a>
<a NAME=1.1.26>So fair an outward and such stuff within</a>
<a NAME=1.1.27>Endows a man but he.</a>

<a NAME=1.1.29>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</a>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech11><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.33>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</a>
<a NAME=1.1.34>Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour</a>
<a NAME=1.1.35>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.36>But had his titles by Tenantius whom</a>
<a NAME=1.1.37>He served with glory and admired success,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.38>So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.39>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.40>Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time</a>
<a NAME=1.1.41>Died with their swords in hand; for which</a>
<a NAME=1.1.42>their father,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.43>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</a>
<a NAME=1.1.44>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.45>Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased</a>
<a NAME=1.1.46>As he was born. The king he takes the babe</a>
<a NAME=1.1.47>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.48>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.49>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</a>
<a NAME=1.1.50>Could make him the receiver of; which he took,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.51>As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.52>And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--</a>
<a NAME=1.1.53>Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.54>A sample to the youngest, to the more mature</a>
<a NAME=1.1.55>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</a>
<a NAME=1.1.56>A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.57>For whom he now is banish'd, her own price</a>
<a NAME=1.1.58>Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.59>By her election may be truly read</a>
<a NAME=1.1.60>What kind of man he is.</a>
