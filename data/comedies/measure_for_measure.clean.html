<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.3>Of government the properties to unfold,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.4>Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.5>Since I am put to know that your own science</a>
<a NAME=1.1.6>Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice</a>
<a NAME=1.1.7>My strength can give you: then no more remains,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.8>But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.9>And let them work. The nature of our people,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.10>Our city's institutions, and the terms</a>
<a NAME=1.1.11>For common justice, you're as pregnant in</a>
<a NAME=1.1.12>As art and practise hath enriched any</a>
<a NAME=1.1.13>That we remember. There is our commission,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.14>From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.15>I say, bid come before us Angelo.</a>
<a NAME=1.1.16>What figure of us think you he will bear?</a>
<a NAME=1.1.17>For you must know, we have with special soul</a>
<a NAME=1.1.18>Elected him our absence to supply,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.19>Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.20>And given his deputation all the organs</a>
<a NAME=1.1.21>Of our own power: what think you of it?</a>

<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.28>Angelo,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.29>There is a kind of character in thy life,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.30>That to the observer doth thy history</a>
<a NAME=1.1.31>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</a>
<a NAME=1.1.32>Are not thine own so proper as to waste</a>
<a NAME=1.1.33>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</a>
<a NAME=1.1.34>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.35>Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</a>
<a NAME=1.1.36>Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike</a>
<a NAME=1.1.37>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd</a>
<a NAME=1.1.38>But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends</a>
<a NAME=1.1.39>The smallest scruple of her excellence</a>
<a NAME=1.1.40>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</a>
<a NAME=1.1.41>Herself the glory of a creditor,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.42>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</a>
<a NAME=1.1.43>To one that can my part in him advertise;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.44>Hold therefore, Angelo:--</a>
<a NAME=1.1.45>In our remove be thou at full ourself;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.46>Mortality and mercy in Vienna</a>
<a NAME=1.1.47>Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.48>Though first in question, is thy secondary.</a>
<a NAME=1.1.49>Take thy commission.</a>

<a NAME=1.1.52>Before so noble and so great a figure</a>
<a NAME=1.1.53>Be stamp'd upon it.</a>

<a NAME=1.1.54>No more evasion:</a>

<a NAME=1.1.56>Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.</a>
<a NAME=1.1.57>Our haste from hence is of so quick condition</a>
<a NAME=1.1.58>That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd</a>
<a NAME=1.1.59>Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.60>As time and our concernings shall importune,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.61>How it goes with us, and do look to know</a>
<a NAME=1.1.62>What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.63>To the hopeful execution do I leave you</a>
<a NAME=1.1.64>Of your commissions.</a>

<a NAME=speech10><b>ANGELO</b></a>

<a NAME=1.1.68>Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do</a>
<a NAME=1.1.69>With any scruple; your scope is as mine own</a>
<a NAME=1.1.70>So to enforce or qualify the laws</a>
<a NAME=1.1.71>As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:</a>
<a NAME=1.1.72>I'll privily away. I love the people,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.73>But do not like to stage me to their eyes:</a>
<a NAME=1.1.74>Through it do well, I do not relish well</a>
<a NAME=1.1.75>Their loud applause and Aves vehement;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.76>Nor do I think the man of safe discretion</a>
<a NAME=1.1.77>That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</a>

<a NAME=speech15><b>ESCALUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.81>I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave</a>
<a NAME=1.1.82>To have free speech with you; and it concerns me</a>
<a NAME=1.1.83>To look into the bottom of my place:</a>
<a NAME=1.1.84>A power I have, but of what strength and nature</a>
<a NAME=1.1.85>I am not yet instructed.</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech16><b>ANGELO</b></a>

<a NAME=speech7><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.12>Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and</a>
<a NAME=1.2.13>all the rest from their functions: they put forth</a>

</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech8><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.17>I never heard any soldier dislike it.</a>

<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.24>Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all</a>

</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech18><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.35>I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful</a>

</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech37><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech38><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
