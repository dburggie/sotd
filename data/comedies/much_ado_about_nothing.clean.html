<a name="1.1.1">I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon</a>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.3">He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off</a>
<a name="1.1.4">when I left him.</a>

<a name="1.1.6">But few of any sort, and none of name.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech5"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.7">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings</a>
<a name="1.1.8">home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath</a>
<a name="1.1.9">bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech6"><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.10">Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by</a>
<a name="1.1.11">Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the</a>
<a name="1.1.12">promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,</a>
<a name="1.1.13">the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</a>
<a name="1.1.14">bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</a>
<a name="1.1.15">tell you how.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech7"><b>LEONATO</b></a>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.18">I have already delivered him letters, and there</a>

<a name="1.1.20">not show itself modest enough without a badge of</a>
<a name="1.1.21">bitterness.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech9"><b>LEONATO</b></a>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.23">In great measure.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech11"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.24">A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces</a>
<a name="1.1.25">truer than those that are so washed. How much</a>
<a name="1.1.26">better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</a>

<a name="1.1.33">O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech17"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.34">He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged</a>
<a name="1.1.35">Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading</a>
<a name="1.1.36">the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged</a>
<a name="1.1.37">him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he</a>
<a name="1.1.38">killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath</a>
<a name="1.1.39">he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech18"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.40">Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;</a>

<a name="1.1.43">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:</a>

<a name="1.1.45">excellent stomach.</a>
</blockquote>

<a name="1.1.46">And a good soldier too, lady.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech22"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.47">And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech23"><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.48">A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all</a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech24"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.50">It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:</a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech25"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.52">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a</a>
<a name="1.1.53">kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:</a>
<a name="1.1.54">they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit</a>
<a name="1.1.55">between them.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech26"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.56">Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last</a>
<a name="1.1.57">conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and</a>
<a name="1.1.58">now is the whole man governed with one: so that if</a>
<a name="1.1.59">he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</a>
<a name="1.1.60">bear it for a difference between himself and his</a>
<a name="1.1.61">horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,</a>
<a name="1.1.62">to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his</a>
<a name="1.1.63">companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech27"><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.64">Is't possible?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech28"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.65">Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as</a>
<a name="1.1.66">the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the</a>
<a name="1.1.67">next block.</a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech30"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.69">No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray</a>
<a name="1.1.70">you, who is his companion? Is there no young</a>
<a name="1.1.71">squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</a>
</blockquote>

<a name="1.1.72">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech32"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.73">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he</a>
<a name="1.1.74">is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker</a>
<a name="1.1.75">runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if</a>
<a name="1.1.76">he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a</a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech38"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.83">Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your</a>
<a name="1.1.84">trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid</a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech39"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.86">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of</a>
<a name="1.1.87">your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should</a>
<a name="1.1.88">remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides</a>
<a name="1.1.89">and happiness takes his leave.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech40"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.90">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this</a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech41"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.92">Her mother hath many times told me so.</a>
</blockquote>

<a name="speech43"><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.94">Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech44"><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.95">You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this</a>
<a name="1.1.96">what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers</a>
<a name="1.1.97">herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an</a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech46"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech48"><b>BEATRICE</b></a>

<a name="1.1.108">in her presence.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech49"><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.109">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I</a>

<a name="1.1.111">would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard</a>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.113">A dear happiness to women: they would else have</a>
<a name="1.1.114">been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God</a>
<a name="1.1.115">and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I</a>
