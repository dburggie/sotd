<title>The History of Troilus and Cressida</title>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.0.1">In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</a>
<a name="1.0.2">The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,</a>
<a name="1.0.3">Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,</a>
<a name="1.0.4">Fraught with the ministers and instruments</a>
<a name="1.0.5">Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore</a>
<a name="1.0.6">Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay</a>
<a name="1.0.7">Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made</a>
<a name="1.0.8">To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</a>
<a name="1.0.9">The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,</a>
<a name="1.0.10">With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.</a>
<a name="1.0.11">To Tenedos they come;</a>
<a name="1.0.12">And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</a>
<a name="1.0.13">Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains</a>
<a name="1.0.14">The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</a>
<a name="1.0.15">Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,</a>
<a name="1.0.16">Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,</a>
<a name="1.0.17">And Antenorides, with massy staples</a>
<a name="1.0.18">And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,</a>
<a name="1.0.19">Sperr up the sons of Troy.</a>
<a name="1.0.20">Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,</a>
<a name="1.0.21">On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,</a>
<a name="1.0.22">Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come</a>
<a name="1.0.23">A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence</a>
<a name="1.0.24">Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited</a>
<a name="1.0.25">In like conditions as our argument,</a>
<a name="1.0.26">To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</a>
<a name="1.0.27">Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,</a>
<a name="1.0.28">Beginning in the middle, starting thence away</a>
<a name="1.0.29">To what may be digested in a play.</a>
<a name="1.0.30">Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:</a>
<a name="1.0.31">Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech1"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.1">Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:</a>
<a name="1.1.2">Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</a>
<a name="1.1.3">That find such cruel battle here within?</a>
<a name="1.1.4">Each Trojan that is master of his heart,</a>
<a name="1.1.5">Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech2"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.6">Will this gear ne'er be mended?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech3"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.7">The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,</a>
<a name="1.1.8">Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;</a>
<a name="1.1.9">But I am weaker than a woman's tear,</a>
<a name="1.1.10">Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</a>
<a name="1.1.11">Less valiant than the virgin in the night</a>
<a name="1.1.12">And skilless as unpractised infancy.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech4"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.13">Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,</a>
<a name="1.1.14">I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will</a>
<a name="1.1.15">have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech5"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.16">Have I not tarried?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech6"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.17">Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry</a>
<a name="1.1.18">the bolting.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech7"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.19">Have I not tarried?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech8"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.20">Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech9"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.21">Still have I tarried.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech10"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.22">Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word</a>
<a name="1.1.23">'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the</a>
<a name="1.1.24">heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must</a>
<a name="1.1.25">stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech11"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.26">Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,</a>
<a name="1.1.27">Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.</a>
<a name="1.1.28">At Priam's royal table do I sit;</a>
<a name="1.1.29">And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--</a>
<a name="1.1.30">So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech12"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.31">Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw</a>
<a name="1.1.32">her look, or any woman else.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech13"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.33">I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,</a>
<a name="1.1.34">As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</a>
<a name="1.1.35">Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</a>
<a name="1.1.36">I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,</a>
<a name="1.1.37">Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:</a>
<a name="1.1.38">But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,</a>
<a name="1.1.39">Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech14"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.40">An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--</a>
<a name="1.1.41">well, go to--there were no more comparison between</a>
<a name="1.1.42">the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I</a>
<a name="1.1.43">would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would</a>
<a name="1.1.44">somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I</a>
<a name="1.1.45">will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech15"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.46">O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--</a>
<a name="1.1.47">When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,</a>
<a name="1.1.48">Reply not in how many fathoms deep</a>
<a name="1.1.49">They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad</a>
<a name="1.1.50">In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'</a>
<a name="1.1.51">Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart</a>
<a name="1.1.52">Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</a>
<a name="1.1.53">Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</a>
<a name="1.1.54">In whose comparison all whites are ink,</a>
<a name="1.1.55">Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure</a>
<a name="1.1.56">The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense</a>
<a name="1.1.57">Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,</a>
<a name="1.1.58">As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;</a>
<a name="1.1.59">But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,</a>
<a name="1.1.60">Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me</a>
<a name="1.1.61">The knife that made it.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech16"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.62">I speak no more than truth.</a>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.63">Thou dost not speak so much.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech18"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.64">Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:</a>
<a name="1.1.65">if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be</a>
<a name="1.1.66">not, she has the mends in her own hands.</a>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.67">Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech20"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.68">I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of</a>
<a name="1.1.69">her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and</a>
<a name="1.1.70">between, but small thanks for my labour.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech21"><b>TROILUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.71">What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech22"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.72">Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair</a>
<a name="1.1.73">as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as</a>
<a name="1.1.74">fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care</a>
<a name="1.1.75">I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.</a>
</blockquote>

<a name="1.1.76">Say I she is not fair?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech24"><b>PANDARUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.77">I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to</a>
<a name="1.1.78">stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so</a>
<a name="1.1.79">I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,</a>

<a name="1.1.84">Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I</a>

<a name="1.1.87">Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,</a>
<a name="1.1.88">When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</a>
<a name="1.1.89">I cannot fight upon this argument;</a>
<a name="1.1.90">It is too starved a subject for my sword.</a>
<a name="1.1.91">But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!</a>
<a name="1.1.92">I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;</a>
<a name="1.1.93">And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.</a>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.2.22">This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their</a>

<a name="1.2.28">hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he</a>
<a name="1.2.29">carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without</a>
<a name="1.2.30">cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the</a>
<a name="1.2.31">joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint</a>
<a name="1.2.32">that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,</a>
