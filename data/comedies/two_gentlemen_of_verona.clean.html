<title>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</title>
<a name="speech1"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.1">Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:</a>
<a name="1.1.2">Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.</a>
<a name="1.1.3">Were't not affection chains thy tender days</a>
<a name="1.1.4">To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,</a>
<a name="1.1.5">I rather would entreat thy company</a>
<a name="1.1.6">To see the wonders of the world abroad,</a>
<a name="1.1.7">Than, living dully sluggardized at home,</a>
<a name="1.1.8">Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</a>
<a name="1.1.9">But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,</a>
<a name="1.1.10">Even as I would when I to love begin.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech2"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.11">Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!</a>
<a name="1.1.12">Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest</a>
<a name="1.1.13">Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:</a>
<a name="1.1.14">Wish me partaker in thy happiness</a>
<a name="1.1.15">When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,</a>
<a name="1.1.16">If ever danger do environ thee,</a>
<a name="1.1.17">Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</a>
<a name="1.1.18">For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech3"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.19">And on a love-book pray for my success?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech4"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.20">Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech5"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.21">That's on some shallow story of deep love:</a>
<a name="1.1.22">How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech6"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.23">That's a deep story of a deeper love:</a>
<a name="1.1.24">For he was more than over shoes in love.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech7"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.25">'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,</a>
<a name="1.1.26">And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech8"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.27">Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech9"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.28">No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech10"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.29">What?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech11"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.30">To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;</a>
<a name="1.1.31">Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth</a>
<a name="1.1.32">With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:</a>
<a name="1.1.33">If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;</a>
<a name="1.1.34">If lost, why then a grievous labour won;</a>
<a name="1.1.35">However, but a folly bought with wit,</a>
<a name="1.1.36">Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech12"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.37">So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech13"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.38">So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech14"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.39">'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech15"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.40">Love is your master, for he masters you:</a>
<a name="1.1.41">And he that is so yoked by a fool,</a>
<a name="1.1.42">Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech16"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.43">Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud</a>
<a name="1.1.44">The eating canker dwells, so eating love</a>
<a name="1.1.45">Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech17"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.46">And writers say, as the most forward bud</a>
<a name="1.1.47">Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</a>
<a name="1.1.48">Even so by love the young and tender wit</a>
<a name="1.1.49">Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,</a>
<a name="1.1.50">Losing his verdure even in the prime</a>
<a name="1.1.51">And all the fair effects of future hopes.</a>
<a name="1.1.52">But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,</a>
<a name="1.1.53">That art a votary to fond desire?</a>
<a name="1.1.54">Once more adieu! my father at the road</a>
<a name="1.1.55">Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech18"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.56">And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech19"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.57">Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.</a>
<a name="1.1.58">To Milan let me hear from thee by letters</a>
<a name="1.1.59">Of thy success in love, and what news else</a>
<a name="1.1.60">Betideth here in absence of thy friend;</a>
<a name="1.1.61">And likewise will visit thee with mine.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech20"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.62">All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech21"><b>VALENTINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.63">As much to you at home! and so, farewell.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech22"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.64">He after honour hunts, I after love:</a>
<a name="1.1.65">He leaves his friends to dignify them more,</a>
<a name="1.1.66">I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.</a>
<a name="1.1.67">Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,</a>
<a name="1.1.68">Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,</a>
<a name="1.1.69">War with good counsel, set the world at nought;</a>
<a name="1.1.70">Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech23"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.71">Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech24"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.72">But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech25"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.73">Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,</a>
<a name="1.1.74">And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech26"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.75">Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,</a>
<a name="1.1.76">An if the shepherd be a while away.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech27"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.77">You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,</a>
<a name="1.1.78">and I a sheep?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech28"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.79">I do.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech29"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.80">Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech30"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.81">A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech31"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.82">This proves me still a sheep.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech32"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.83">True; and thy master a shepherd.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech33"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.84">Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech34"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.85">It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech35"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.86">The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the</a>
<a name="1.1.87">shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks</a>
<a name="1.1.88">not me: therefore I am no sheep.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech36"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.89">The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the</a>
<a name="1.1.90">shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for</a>
<a name="1.1.91">wages followest thy master; thy master for wages</a>
<a name="1.1.92">follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech37"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.93">Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech38"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.94">But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech39"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.95">Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,</a>
<a name="1.1.96">a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a</a>
<a name="1.1.97">lost mutton, nothing for my labour.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech40"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.98">Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech41"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.99">If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech42"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.100">Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech43"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.101">Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for</a>
<a name="1.1.102">carrying your letter.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech44"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.103">You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech45"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.104">From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,</a>
<a name="1.1.105">'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to</a>
<a name="1.1.106">your lover.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech46"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.107">But what said she?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech47"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.108">[First nodding]  Ay.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech48"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.109">Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech49"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.110">You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask</a>
<a name="1.1.111">me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech50"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.112">And that set together is noddy.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech51"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.113">Now you have taken the pains to set it together,</a>
<a name="1.1.114">take it for your pains.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech52"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.115">No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech53"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.116">Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech54"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.117">Why sir, how do you bear with me?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech55"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.118">Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing</a>
<a name="1.1.119">but the word 'noddy' for my pains.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech56"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.120">Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech57"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.121">And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech58"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.122">Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech59"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.123">Open your purse, that the money and the matter may</a>
<a name="1.1.124">be both at once delivered.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech60"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.125">Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech61"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.126">Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech62"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.127">Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech63"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.128">Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,</a>
<a name="1.1.129">not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:</a>
<a name="1.1.130">and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I</a>
<a name="1.1.131">fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your</a>
<a name="1.1.132">mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as</a>
<a name="1.1.133">hard as steel.</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech64"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.134">What said she? nothing?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech65"><b>SPEED</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.135">No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To</a>
<a name="1.1.136">testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned</a>
<a name="1.1.137">me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your</a>

</blockquote>
<a name="speech66"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>

<a name="1.1.139">Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,</a>
<a name="1.1.140">Which cannot perish having thee aboard,</a>
<a name="1.1.141">Being destined to a drier death on shore.</a>
<a name="1.1.142">I must go send some better messenger:</a>

<blockquote>
<a name="1.2.9">What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech6"><b>LUCETTA</b></a>

<a name="4.4.3">puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or</a>
