<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.1.1>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.2>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.3>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</a>
<a NAME=1.1.4>To be commenced in strands afar remote.</a>
<a NAME=1.1.5>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</a>
<a NAME=1.1.6>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.7>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.8>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</a>
<a NAME=1.1.9>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.10>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.11>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.12>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</a>
<a NAME=1.1.13>And furious close of civil butchery</a>
<a NAME=1.1.14>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.15>March all one way and be no more opposed</a>
<a NAME=1.1.16>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:</a>
<a NAME=1.1.17>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.18>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.19>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.20>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</a>
<a NAME=1.1.21>We are impressed and engaged to fight,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.22>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.23>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb</a>
<a NAME=1.1.24>To chase these pagans in those holy fields</a>
<a NAME=1.1.25>Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet</a>
<a NAME=1.1.26>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd</a>
<a NAME=1.1.27>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</a>
<a NAME=1.1.28>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.29>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:</a>
<a NAME=1.1.30>Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</a>
<a NAME=1.1.31>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.32>What yesternight our council did decree</a>
<a NAME=1.1.33>In forwarding this dear expedience.</a>

<a NAME=1.1.35>And many limits of the charge set down</a>
<a NAME=1.1.36>But yesternight: when all athwart there came</a>
<a NAME=1.1.37>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.38>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.39>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</a>
<a NAME=1.1.40>Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.41>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.42>A thousand of his people butchered;</a>
<a NAME=1.1.43>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.44>Such beastly shameless transformation,</a>

<a NAME=1.1.54>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</a>

<a NAME=1.1.56>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</a>
<a NAME=1.1.57>As by discharge of their artillery,</a>

<a NAME=1.1.59>For he that brought them, in the very heat</a>

<a NAME=1.1.69>Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see</a>
<a NAME=1.1.70>On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</a>

<a NAME=1.1.88>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</a>
