<title>The Life and Death of Henry the Fifth</title>

<a name="1.0.1">O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend</a>
<a name="1.0.2">The brightest heaven of invention,</a>
<a name="1.0.3">A kingdom for a stage, princes to act</a>
<a name="1.0.4">And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</a>
<a name="1.0.5">Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</a>
<a name="1.0.6">Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,</a>
<a name="1.0.7">Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire</a>
<a name="1.0.8">Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,</a>
<a name="1.0.9">The flat unraised spirits that have dared</a>
<a name="1.0.10">On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</a>
<a name="1.0.11">So great an object: can this cockpit hold</a>
<a name="1.0.12">The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</a>
<a name="1.0.13">Within this wooden O the very casques</a>
<a name="1.0.14">That did affright the air at Agincourt?</a>
<a name="1.0.15">O, pardon! since a crooked figure may</a>
<a name="1.0.16">Attest in little place a million;</a>
<a name="1.0.17">And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,</a>
<a name="1.0.18">On your imaginary forces work.</a>
<a name="1.0.19">Suppose within the girdle of these walls</a>
<a name="1.0.20">Are now confined two mighty monarchies,</a>
<a name="1.0.21">Whose high upreared and abutting fronts</a>
<a name="1.0.22">The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:</a>
<a name="1.0.23">Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;</a>
<a name="1.0.24">Into a thousand parts divide on man,</a>
<a name="1.0.25">And make imaginary puissance;</a>
<a name="1.0.26">Think when we talk of horses, that you see them</a>
<a name="1.0.27">Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;</a>
<a name="1.0.28">For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</a>
<a name="1.0.29">Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,</a>
<a name="1.0.30">Turning the accomplishment of many years</a>
<a name="1.0.31">Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,</a>
<a name="1.0.32">Admit me Chorus to this history;</a>
<a name="1.0.33">Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,</a>

<a name="1.2.37">To this imperial throne. There is no bar</a>
<a name="1.2.38">To make against your highness' claim to France</a>
<a name="1.2.39">But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</a>
<a name="1.2.40">'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</a>
<a name="1.2.41">'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</a>
<a name="1.2.42">Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</a>
<a name="1.2.43">To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</a>
<a name="1.2.44">The founder of this law and female bar.</a>
<a name="1.2.45">Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</a>
<a name="1.2.46">That the land Salique is in Germany,</a>
<a name="1.2.47">Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</a>
<a name="1.2.48">Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</a>
<a name="1.2.49">There left behind and settled certain French;</a>
<a name="1.2.50">Who, holding in disdain the German women</a>
<a name="1.2.51">For some dishonest manners of their life,</a>
<a name="1.2.52">Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</a>
<a name="1.2.53">Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</a>
<a name="1.2.54">Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</a>
<a name="1.2.55">Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</a>
<a name="1.2.56">Then doth it well appear that Salique law</a>
<a name="1.2.57">Was not devised for the realm of France:</a>
<a name="1.2.58">Nor did the French possess the Salique land</a>
<a name="1.2.59">Until four hundred one and twenty years</a>
<a name="1.2.60">After defunction of King Pharamond,</a>
<a name="1.2.61">Idly supposed the founder of this law;</a>
<a name="1.2.62">Who died within the year of our redemption</a>
<a name="1.2.63">Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</a>
<a name="1.2.64">Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</a>
<a name="1.2.65">Beyond the river Sala, in the year</a>
<a name="1.2.66">Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</a>
<a name="1.2.67">King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</a>
<a name="1.2.68">Did, as heir general, being descended</a>
<a name="1.2.69">Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</a>
<a name="1.2.70">Make claim and title to the crown of France.</a>
<a name="1.2.71">Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</a>
<a name="1.2.72">Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</a>
<a name="1.2.73">Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</a>
<a name="1.2.74">To find his title with some shows of truth,</a>
<a name="1.2.75">'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</a>
<a name="1.2.76">Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</a>
<a name="1.2.77">Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</a>
<a name="1.2.78">To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</a>
<a name="1.2.79">Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</a>
<a name="1.2.80">Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</a>
<a name="1.2.81">Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</a>
<a name="1.2.82">Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</a>
<a name="1.2.83">That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</a>
<a name="1.2.84">Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</a>
<a name="1.2.85">Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</a>
<a name="1.2.86">By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</a>
<a name="1.2.87">Was re-united to the crown of France.</a>
<a name="1.2.88">So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</a>
<a name="1.2.89">King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</a>
<a name="1.2.90">King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</a>
<a name="1.2.91">To hold in right and title of the female:</a>
<a name="1.2.92">So do the kings of France unto this day;</a>
<a name="1.2.93">Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</a>
<a name="1.2.94">To bar your highness claiming from the female,</a>
<a name="1.2.95">And rather choose to hide them in a net</a>

<a name="3.2.30">red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</a>

<a name="3.2.32">and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</a>
<a name="3.2.33">words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</a>
<a name="3.2.34">heard that men of few words are the best men; and</a>
<a name="3.2.35">therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</a>
<a name="3.2.36">should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</a>
<a name="3.2.37">are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</a>

<a name="3.2.39">against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</a>
<a name="3.2.40">any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</a>
<a name="3.2.41">lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</a>
<a name="3.2.42">three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</a>
<a name="3.2.43">brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</a>
<a name="3.2.44">fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</a>
