<a NAME=1.0.4>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</a>

<a NAME=1.0.6>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</a>
<a NAME=1.0.7>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</a>
<a NAME=1.0.8>Their money out of hope they may believe,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.9>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</a>
<a NAME=1.0.10>Only a show or two, and so agree</a>
<a NAME=1.0.11>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.12>I'll undertake may see away their shilling</a>
<a NAME=1.0.13>Richly in two short hours. Only they</a>
<a NAME=1.0.14>That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.15>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</a>
<a NAME=1.0.16>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.17>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.18>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</a>
<a NAME=1.0.19>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</a>
<a NAME=1.0.20>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.21>To make that only true we now intend,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.22>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</a>
<a NAME=1.0.23>Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</a>
<a NAME=1.0.24>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.25>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</a>
<a NAME=1.0.26>The very persons of our noble story</a>
<a NAME=1.0.27>As they were living; think you see them great,</a>
<a NAME=1.0.28>And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</a>
<a NAME=1.0.29>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</a>
<a NAME=1.0.30>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</a>

<a NAME=2.4.185>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</a>
<a NAME=2.4.186>Who had been hither sent on the debating</a>
<a NAME=2.4.187>A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</a>

<a NAME=2.4.195>The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</a>
<a NAME=2.4.196>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</a>
<a NAME=2.4.197>The region of my breast; which forced such way,</a>
<a NAME=2.4.198>That many mazed considerings did throng</a>
<a NAME=2.4.199>And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</a>
<a NAME=2.4.200>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</a>
<a NAME=2.4.201>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</a>
<a NAME=2.4.202>If it conceived a male child by me, should</a>
<a NAME=2.4.203>Do no more offices of life to't than</a>
<a NAME=2.4.204>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</a>
<a NAME=2.4.205>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</a>
<a NAME=2.4.206>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</a>
<a NAME=2.4.207>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</a>
<a NAME=2.4.208>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</a>
<a NAME=2.4.209>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</a>
<a NAME=2.4.210>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</a>
<a NAME=2.4.211>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</a>
<a NAME=2.4.212>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</a>
<a NAME=2.4.213>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</a>
<a NAME=2.4.214>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</a>
<a NAME=2.4.215>Now present here together: that's to say,</a>

<a NAME=5.5.23>Though in her cradle, yet now promises</a>
<a NAME=5.5.24>Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.25>Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--</a>
<a NAME=5.5.26>But few now living can behold that goodness--</a>
<a NAME=5.5.27>A pattern to all princes living with her,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.28>And all that shall succeed: Saba was never</a>
<a NAME=5.5.29>More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue</a>
<a NAME=5.5.30>Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.31>That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.32>With all the virtues that attend the good,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.33>Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.34>Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:</a>
<a NAME=5.5.35>She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;</a>
<a NAME=5.5.36>Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.37>And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:</a>
<a NAME=5.5.38>In her days every man shall eat in safety,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.39>Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing</a>
<a NAME=5.5.40>The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:</a>
<a NAME=5.5.41>God shall be truly known; and those about her</a>
<a NAME=5.5.42>From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.43>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</a>
<a NAME=5.5.44>Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when</a>
<a NAME=5.5.45>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.46>Her ashes new create another heir,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.47>As great in admiration as herself;</a>
<a NAME=5.5.48>So shall she leave her blessedness to one,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.49>When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.50>Who from the sacred ashes of her honour</a>
<a NAME=5.5.51>Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.52>And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.53>That were the servants to this chosen infant,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.54>Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:</a>
<a NAME=5.5.55>Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.56>His honour and the greatness of his name</a>
<a NAME=5.5.57>Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.58>And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches</a>
<a NAME=5.5.59>To all the plains about him: our children's children</a>
<a NAME=5.5.60>Shall see this, and bless heaven.</a>

<a NAME=5.5.69>O lord archbishop,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.70>Thou hast made me now a man! never, before</a>
<a NAME=5.5.71>This happy child, did I get any thing:</a>
<a NAME=5.5.72>This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.73>That when I am in heaven I shall desire</a>
<a NAME=5.5.74>To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.</a>
<a NAME=5.5.75>I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.76>And your good brethren, I am much beholding;</a>
<a NAME=5.5.77>I have received much honour by your presence,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.78>And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:</a>
<a NAME=5.5.79>Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.80>She will be sick else. This day, no man think</a>
