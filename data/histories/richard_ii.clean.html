<a NAME=5.5.39>Nor I nor any man that but man is</a>
<a NAME=5.5.40>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</a>
<a NAME=5.5.41>With being nothing. Music do I hear?</a>
<a NAME=5.5.42>Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.43>When time is broke and no proportion kept!</a>
<a NAME=5.5.44>So is it in the music of men's lives.</a>
<a NAME=5.5.45>And here have I the daintiness of ear</a>
<a NAME=5.5.46>To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;</a>
<a NAME=5.5.47>But for the concord of my state and time</a>
<a NAME=5.5.48>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</a>
<a NAME=5.5.49>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</a>
<a NAME=5.5.50>For now hath time made me his numbering clock:</a>
<a NAME=5.5.51>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</a>
<a NAME=5.5.52>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.53>Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.54>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</a>
<a NAME=5.5.55>Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</a>
<a NAME=5.5.56>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.57>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</a>
<a NAME=5.5.58>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</a>
<a NAME=5.5.59>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.60>While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.</a>
<a NAME=5.5.61>This music mads me; let it sound no more;</a>
<a NAME=5.5.62>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</a>
<a NAME=5.5.63>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</a>
<a NAME=5.5.64>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</a>
<a NAME=5.5.65>For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</a>
<a NAME=5.5.66>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</a>
