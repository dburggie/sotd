<title>The Tragedy of Richard the Third</title>
<a name="speech1"><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.1">Now is the winter of our discontent</a>
<a name="1.1.2">Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</a>
<a name="1.1.3">And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house</a>
<a name="1.1.4">In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</a>
<a name="1.1.5">Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</a>
<a name="1.1.6">Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</a>
<a name="1.1.7">Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</a>
<a name="1.1.8">Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</a>
<a name="1.1.9">Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</a>
<a name="1.1.10">And now, instead of mounting barded steeds</a>
<a name="1.1.11">To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</a>
<a name="1.1.12">He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</a>
<a name="1.1.13">To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</a>
<a name="1.1.14">But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</a>
<a name="1.1.15">Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</a>
<a name="1.1.16">I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty</a>
<a name="1.1.17">To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</a>
<a name="1.1.18">I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</a>
<a name="1.1.19">Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</a>
<a name="1.1.20">Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time</a>
<a name="1.1.21">Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</a>
<a name="1.1.22">And that so lamely and unfashionable</a>
<a name="1.1.23">That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</a>
<a name="1.1.24">Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</a>
<a name="1.1.25">Have no delight to pass away the time,</a>
<a name="1.1.26">Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</a>
<a name="1.1.27">And descant on mine own deformity:</a>
<a name="1.1.28">And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</a>
<a name="1.1.29">To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</a>
<a name="1.1.30">I am determined to prove a villain</a>
<a name="1.1.31">And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</a>
<a name="1.1.32">Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</a>
<a name="1.1.33">By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</a>
<a name="1.1.34">To set my brother Clarence and the king</a>
<a name="1.1.35">In deadly hate the one against the other:</a>
<a name="1.1.36">And if King Edward be as true and just</a>
<a name="1.1.37">As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</a>
<a name="1.1.38">This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,</a>
<a name="1.1.39">About a prophecy, which says that 'G'</a>
<a name="1.1.40">Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.</a>
<a name="1.1.41">Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here</a>
<a name="1.1.42">Clarence comes.</a>
<a name="1.1.43">Brother, good day; what means this armed guard</a>
<a name="1.1.44">That waits upon your grace?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech2"><b>CLARENCE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.45">His majesty</a>
<a name="1.1.46">Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed</a>
<a name="1.1.47">This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</a>

<a name="1.1.50">Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</a>

<a name="1.1.53">That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.</a>
<a name="1.1.54">But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?</a>
</blockquote>
<a name="speech6"><b>CLARENCE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.55">Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest</a>
<a name="1.1.56">As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,</a>
<a name="1.1.57">He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;</a>
<a name="1.1.58">And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.</a>
<a name="1.1.59">And says a wizard told him that by G</a>
<a name="1.1.60">His issue disinherited should be;</a>
<a name="1.1.61">And, for my name of George begins with G,</a>
<a name="1.1.62">It follows in his thought that I am he.</a>
<a name="1.1.63">These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</a>
<a name="1.1.64">Have moved his highness to commit me now.</a>

<a name="1.1.67">My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she</a>
<a name="1.1.68">That tempers him to this extremity.</a>
<a name="1.1.69">Was it not she and that good man of worship,</a>
<a name="1.1.70">Anthony Woodville, her brother there,</a>
<a name="1.1.71">That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</a>
<a name="1.1.72">From whence this present day he is deliver'd?</a>

<a name="1.1.82">If we will keep in favour with the king,</a>
<a name="1.1.83">To be her men and wear her livery:</a>
<a name="1.1.84">The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,</a>

<a name="1.1.93">We speak no treason, man: we say the king</a>
<a name="1.1.94">Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</a>
<a name="1.1.95">Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</a>
<a name="1.1.96">We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,</a>
<a name="1.1.97">A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</a>
<a name="1.1.98">And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:</a>
