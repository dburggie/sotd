<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.2.1">When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,</a>
<a NAME="0.2.2">And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,</a>
<a NAME="0.2.3">Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,</a>
<a NAME="0.2.4">Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:</a>
<a NAME="0.2.5">Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,</a>
<a NAME="0.2.6">Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,</a>
<a NAME="0.2.7">To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,</a>
<a NAME="0.2.8">Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.</a>
<a NAME="0.2.9">How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,</a>
<a NAME="0.2.10">If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine</a>
<a NAME="0.2.11">Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'</a>
<a NAME="0.2.12">Proving his beauty by succession thine!</a>
<a NAME="0.2.13">  This were to be new made when thou art old,</a>
<a NAME="0.2.14">  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</a>
