<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.3.1">Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest</a>
<a NAME="0.3.2">Now is the time that face should form another;</a>
<a NAME="0.3.3">Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</a>
<a NAME="0.3.4">Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</a>
<a NAME="0.3.5">For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb</a>
<a NAME="0.3.6">Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</a>
<a NAME="0.3.7">Or who is he so fond will be the tomb</a>
<a NAME="0.3.8">Of his self-love, to stop posterity?</a>
<a NAME="0.3.9">Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee</a>
<a NAME="0.3.10">Calls back the lovely April of her prime:</a>
<a NAME="0.3.11">So thou through windows of thine age shall see</a>
<a NAME="0.3.12">Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</a>
<a NAME="0.3.13">  But if thou live, remember'd not to be,</a>
<a NAME="0.3.14">  Die single, and thine image dies with thee.</a>
