<a NAME="0.5.1">Those hours, that with gentle work did frame</a>
<a NAME="0.5.2">The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,</a>
<a NAME="0.5.3">Will play the tyrants to the very same</a>
<a NAME="0.5.4">And that unfair which fairly doth excel:</a>
<a NAME="0.5.5">For never-resting time leads summer on</a>
<a NAME="0.5.6">To hideous winter and confounds him there;</a>
<a NAME="0.5.7">Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,</a>
<a NAME="0.5.8">Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:</a>
<a NAME="0.5.9">Then, were not summer's distillation left,</a>
<a NAME="0.5.10">A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</a>
<a NAME="0.5.11">Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,</a>
<a NAME="0.5.12">Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:</a>
<a NAME="0.5.13">  But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,</a>
<a NAME="0.5.14">  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</a>
