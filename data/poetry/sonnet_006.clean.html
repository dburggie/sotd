<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.6.1">Then let not winter's ragged hand deface</a>
<a NAME="0.6.2">In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:</a>
<a NAME="0.6.3">Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place</a>
<a NAME="0.6.4">With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.</a>
<a NAME="0.6.5">That use is not forbidden usury,</a>
<a NAME="0.6.6">Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</a>
<a NAME="0.6.7">That's for thyself to breed another thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.6.8">Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;</a>
<a NAME="0.6.9">Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,</a>
<a NAME="0.6.10">If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:</a>
<a NAME="0.6.11">Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,</a>
<a NAME="0.6.12">Leaving thee living in posterity?</a>
<a NAME="0.6.13">  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair</a>
<a NAME="0.6.14">  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.</a>
