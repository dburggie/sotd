<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.7.1">Lo! in the orient when the gracious light</a>
<a NAME="0.7.2">Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</a>
<a NAME="0.7.3">Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</a>
<a NAME="0.7.4">Serving with looks his sacred majesty;</a>
<a NAME="0.7.5">And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,</a>
<a NAME="0.7.6">Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</a>
<a NAME="0.7.7">yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</a>
<a NAME="0.7.8">Attending on his golden pilgrimage;</a>
<a NAME="0.7.9">But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</a>
<a NAME="0.7.10">Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,</a>
<a NAME="0.7.11">The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are</a>
<a NAME="0.7.12">From his low tract and look another way:</a>
<a NAME="0.7.13">  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,</a>
<a NAME="0.7.14">  Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.</a>
