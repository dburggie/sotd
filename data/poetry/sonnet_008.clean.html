<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.8.1">Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?</a>
<a NAME="0.8.2">Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.</a>
<a NAME="0.8.3">Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,</a>
<a NAME="0.8.4">Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?</a>
<a NAME="0.8.5">If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</a>
<a NAME="0.8.6">By unions married, do offend thine ear,</a>
<a NAME="0.8.7">They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</a>
<a NAME="0.8.8">In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.</a>
<a NAME="0.8.9">Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,</a>
<a NAME="0.8.10">Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,</a>
<a NAME="0.8.11">Resembling sire and child and happy mother</a>
<a NAME="0.8.12">Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</a>
<a NAME="0.8.13">  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,</a>
<a NAME="0.8.14">  Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'</a>
