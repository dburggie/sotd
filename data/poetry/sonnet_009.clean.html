<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.9.1">Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye</a>
<a NAME="0.9.2">That thou consumest thyself in single life?</a>
<a NAME="0.9.3">Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.</a>
<a NAME="0.9.4">The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;</a>
<a NAME="0.9.5">The world will be thy widow and still weep</a>
<a NAME="0.9.6">That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</a>
<a NAME="0.9.7">When every private widow well may keep</a>
<a NAME="0.9.8">By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.</a>
<a NAME="0.9.9">Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend</a>
<a NAME="0.9.10">Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;</a>
<a NAME="0.9.11">But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,</a>
<a NAME="0.9.12">And kept unused, the user so destroys it.</a>
<a NAME="0.9.13">  No love toward others in that bosom sits</a>
<a NAME="0.9.14">  That on himself such murderous shame commits.</a>
