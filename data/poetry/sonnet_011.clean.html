<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.11.1">As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest</a>
<a NAME="0.11.2">In one of thine, from that which thou departest;</a>
<a NAME="0.11.3">And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest</a>
<a NAME="0.11.4">Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.</a>
<a NAME="0.11.5">Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:</a>
<a NAME="0.11.6">Without this, folly, age and cold decay:</a>
<a NAME="0.11.7">If all were minded so, the times should cease</a>
<a NAME="0.11.8">And threescore year would make the world away.</a>
<a NAME="0.11.9">Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,</a>
<a NAME="0.11.10">Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:</a>
<a NAME="0.11.11">Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;</a>
<a NAME="0.11.12">Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:</a>
<a NAME="0.11.13">  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby</a>
<a NAME="0.11.14">  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</a>
