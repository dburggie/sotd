<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.12.1">When I do count the clock that tells the time,</a>
<a NAME="0.12.2">And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;</a>
<a NAME="0.12.3">When I behold the violet past prime,</a>
<a NAME="0.12.4">And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;</a>
<a NAME="0.12.5">When lofty trees I see barren of leaves</a>
<a NAME="0.12.6">Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,</a>
<a NAME="0.12.7">And summer's green all girded up in sheaves</a>
<a NAME="0.12.8">Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,</a>
<a NAME="0.12.9">Then of thy beauty do I question make,</a>
<a NAME="0.12.10">That thou among the wastes of time must go,</a>
<a NAME="0.12.11">Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake</a>
<a NAME="0.12.12">And die as fast as they see others grow;</a>
<a NAME="0.12.13">  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence</a>
<a NAME="0.12.14">  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</a>
