<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.13.1">O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are</a>
<a NAME="0.13.2">No longer yours than you yourself here live:</a>
<a NAME="0.13.3">Against this coming end you should prepare,</a>
<a NAME="0.13.4">And your sweet semblance to some other give.</a>
<a NAME="0.13.5">So should that beauty which you hold in lease</a>
<a NAME="0.13.6">Find no determination: then you were</a>
<a NAME="0.13.7">Yourself again after yourself's decease,</a>
<a NAME="0.13.8">When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</a>
<a NAME="0.13.9">Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</a>
<a NAME="0.13.10">Which husbandry in honour might uphold</a>
<a NAME="0.13.11">Against the stormy gusts of winter's day</a>
<a NAME="0.13.12">And barren rage of death's eternal cold?</a>
<a NAME="0.13.13">  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know</a>
<a NAME="0.13.14">  You had a father: let your son say so.</a>
