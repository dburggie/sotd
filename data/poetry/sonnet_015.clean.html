<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.15.1">When I consider every thing that grows</a>
<a NAME="0.15.2">Holds in perfection but a little moment,</a>
<a NAME="0.15.3">That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</a>
<a NAME="0.15.4">Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;</a>
<a NAME="0.15.5">When I perceive that men as plants increase,</a>
<a NAME="0.15.6">Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,</a>
<a NAME="0.15.7">Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</a>
<a NAME="0.15.8">And wear their brave state out of memory;</a>
<a NAME="0.15.9">Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</a>
<a NAME="0.15.10">Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</a>
<a NAME="0.15.11">Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,</a>
<a NAME="0.15.12">To change your day of youth to sullied night;</a>
<a NAME="0.15.13">  And all in war with Time for love of you,</a>
<a NAME="0.15.14">  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</a>
