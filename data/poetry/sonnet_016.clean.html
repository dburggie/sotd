<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.16.1">But wherefore do not you a mightier way</a>
<a NAME="0.16.2">Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?</a>
<a NAME="0.16.3">And fortify yourself in your decay</a>
<a NAME="0.16.4">With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</a>
<a NAME="0.16.5">Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</a>
<a NAME="0.16.6">And many maiden gardens yet unset</a>
<a NAME="0.16.7">With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,</a>
<a NAME="0.16.8">Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</a>
<a NAME="0.16.9">So should the lines of life that life repair,</a>
<a NAME="0.16.10">Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,</a>
<a NAME="0.16.11">Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,</a>
<a NAME="0.16.12">Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.</a>
<a NAME="0.16.13">  To give away yourself keeps yourself still,</a>
<a NAME="0.16.14">  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.</a>
