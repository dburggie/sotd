<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.17.1">Who will believe my verse in time to come,</a>
<a NAME="0.17.2">If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?</a>
<a NAME="0.17.3">Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb</a>
<a NAME="0.17.4">Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.</a>
<a NAME="0.17.5">If I could write the beauty of your eyes</a>
<a NAME="0.17.6">And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</a>
<a NAME="0.17.7">The age to come would say 'This poet lies:</a>
<a NAME="0.17.8">Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'</a>
<a NAME="0.17.9">So should my papers yellow'd with their age</a>
<a NAME="0.17.10">Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,</a>
<a NAME="0.17.11">And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage</a>
<a NAME="0.17.12">And stretched metre of an antique song:</a>
<a NAME="0.17.13">  But were some child of yours alive that time,</a>
<a NAME="0.17.14">  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.</a>
