<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.18.1">Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</a>
<a NAME="0.18.2">Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</a>
<a NAME="0.18.3">Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</a>
<a NAME="0.18.4">And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</a>
<a NAME="0.18.5">Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</a>
<a NAME="0.18.6">And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;</a>
<a NAME="0.18.7">And every fair from fair sometime declines,</a>
<a NAME="0.18.8">By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;</a>
<a NAME="0.18.9">But thy eternal summer shall not fade</a>
<a NAME="0.18.10">Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;</a>
<a NAME="0.18.11">Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</a>
<a NAME="0.18.12">When in eternal lines to time thou growest:</a>
<a NAME="0.18.13">  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</a>
<a NAME="0.18.14">  So long lives this and this gives life to thee.</a>
