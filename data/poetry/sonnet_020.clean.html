<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.20.1">A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted</a>
<a NAME="0.20.2">Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;</a>
<a NAME="0.20.3">A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted</a>
<a NAME="0.20.4">With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;</a>
<a NAME="0.20.5">An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,</a>
<a NAME="0.20.6">Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;</a>
<a NAME="0.20.7">A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,</a>
<a NAME="0.20.8">Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.</a>
<a NAME="0.20.9">And for a woman wert thou first created;</a>
<a NAME="0.20.10">Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,</a>
<a NAME="0.20.11">And by addition me of thee defeated,</a>
<a NAME="0.20.12">By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.</a>
<a NAME="0.20.13">  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,</a>
<a NAME="0.20.14">  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.</a>
