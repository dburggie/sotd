<h1>Sonnet XX</h1>

<blockquote>A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted<br>
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;<br>
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted<br>
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;<br>
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,<br>
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;<br>
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,<br>
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.<br>
And for a woman wert thou first created;<br>
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,<br>
And by addition me of thee defeated,<br>
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<br>
  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,<br>
  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.<br>
</blockquote>
