<a NAME="0.21.1">So is it not with me as with that Muse</a>
<a NAME="0.21.2">Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,</a>
<a NAME="0.21.3">Who heaven itself for ornament doth use</a>
<a NAME="0.21.4">And every fair with his fair doth rehearse</a>
<a NAME="0.21.5">Making a couplement of proud compare,</a>
<a NAME="0.21.6">With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,</a>
<a NAME="0.21.7">With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare</a>
<a NAME="0.21.8">That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.</a>
<a NAME="0.21.9">O' let me, true in love, but truly write,</a>
<a NAME="0.21.10">And then believe me, my love is as fair</a>
<a NAME="0.21.11">As any mother's child, though not so bright</a>
<a NAME="0.21.12">As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:</a>
<a NAME="0.21.13">  Let them say more than like of hearsay well;</a>
<a NAME="0.21.14">  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</a>
