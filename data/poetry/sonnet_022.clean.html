<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.22.1">My glass shall not persuade me I am old,</a>
<a NAME="0.22.2">So long as youth and thou are of one date;</a>
<a NAME="0.22.3">But when in thee time's furrows I behold,</a>
<a NAME="0.22.4">Then look I death my days should expiate.</a>
<a NAME="0.22.5">For all that beauty that doth cover thee</a>
<a NAME="0.22.6">Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</a>
<a NAME="0.22.7">Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:</a>
<a NAME="0.22.8">How can I then be elder than thou art?</a>
<a NAME="0.22.9">O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary</a>
<a NAME="0.22.10">As I, not for myself, but for thee will;</a>
<a NAME="0.22.11">Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary</a>
<a NAME="0.22.12">As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</a>
<a NAME="0.22.13">  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;</a>
<a NAME="0.22.14">  Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.</a>
