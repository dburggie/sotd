<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.23.1">As an unperfect actor on the stage</a>
<a NAME="0.23.2">Who with his fear is put besides his part,</a>
<a NAME="0.23.3">Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,</a>
<a NAME="0.23.4">Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.</a>
<a NAME="0.23.5">So I, for fear of trust, forget to say</a>
<a NAME="0.23.6">The perfect ceremony of love's rite,</a>
<a NAME="0.23.7">And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,</a>
<a NAME="0.23.8">O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.</a>
<a NAME="0.23.9">O, let my books be then the eloquence</a>
<a NAME="0.23.10">And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,</a>
<a NAME="0.23.11">Who plead for love and look for recompense</a>
<a NAME="0.23.12">More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.</a>
<a NAME="0.23.13">  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:</a>
<a NAME="0.23.14">  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.</a>
