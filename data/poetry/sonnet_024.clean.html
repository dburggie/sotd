<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.24.1">Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd</a>
<a NAME="0.24.2">Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;</a>
<a NAME="0.24.3">My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,</a>
<a NAME="0.24.4">And perspective it is the painter's art.</a>
<a NAME="0.24.5">For through the painter must you see his skill,</a>
<a NAME="0.24.6">To find where your true image pictured lies;</a>
<a NAME="0.24.7">Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,</a>
<a NAME="0.24.8">That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.</a>
<a NAME="0.24.9">Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:</a>
<a NAME="0.24.10">Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me</a>
<a NAME="0.24.11">Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun</a>
<a NAME="0.24.12">Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;</a>
<a NAME="0.24.13">  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;</a>
<a NAME="0.24.14">  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</a>
