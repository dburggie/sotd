<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.25.1">Let those who are in favour with their stars</a>
<a NAME="0.25.2">Of public honour and proud titles boast,</a>
<a NAME="0.25.3">Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,</a>
<a NAME="0.25.4">Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.</a>
<a NAME="0.25.5">Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread</a>
<a NAME="0.25.6">But as the marigold at the sun's eye,</a>
<a NAME="0.25.7">And in themselves their pride lies buried,</a>
<a NAME="0.25.8">For at a frown they in their glory die.</a>
<a NAME="0.25.9">The painful warrior famoused for fight,</a>
<a NAME="0.25.10">After a thousand victories once foil'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.25.11">Is from the book of honour razed quite,</a>
<a NAME="0.25.12">And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:</a>
<a NAME="0.25.13">  Then happy I, that love and am beloved</a>
<a NAME="0.25.14">  Where I may not remove nor be removed.</a>
