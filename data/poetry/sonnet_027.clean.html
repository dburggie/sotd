<a name="speech"><b>Sonnet XXVII</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.27.1">Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,</a>
<a NAME="0.27.2">The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;</a>
<a NAME="0.27.3">But then begins a journey in my head,</a>
<a NAME="0.27.4">To work my mind, when body's work's expired:</a>
<a NAME="0.27.5">For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,</a>
<a NAME="0.27.6">Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.27.7">And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,</a>
<a NAME="0.27.8">Looking on darkness which the blind do see</a>
<a NAME="0.27.9">Save that my soul's imaginary sight</a>
<a NAME="0.27.10">Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,</a>
<a NAME="0.27.11">Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,</a>
<a NAME="0.27.12">Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.</a>
<a NAME="0.27.13">  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,</a>
<a NAME="0.27.14">  For thee and for myself no quiet find.</a>
