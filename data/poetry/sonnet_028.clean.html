<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.28.1">How can I then return in happy plight,</a>
<a NAME="0.28.2">That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?</a>
<a NAME="0.28.3">When day's oppression is not eased by night,</a>
<a NAME="0.28.4">But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?</a>
<a NAME="0.28.5">And each, though enemies to either's reign,</a>
<a NAME="0.28.6">Do in consent shake hands to torture me;</a>
<a NAME="0.28.7">The one by toil, the other to complain</a>
<a NAME="0.28.8">How far I toil, still farther off from thee.</a>
<a NAME="0.28.9">I tell the day, to please them thou art bright</a>
<a NAME="0.28.10">And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:</a>
<a NAME="0.28.11">So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,</a>
<a NAME="0.28.12">When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.</a>
<a NAME="0.28.13">  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer</a>
<a NAME="0.28.14">  And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem stronger.</a>
