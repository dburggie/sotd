<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.29.1">When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,</a>
<a NAME="0.29.2">I all alone beweep my outcast state</a>
<a NAME="0.29.3">And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries</a>
<a NAME="0.29.4">And look upon myself and curse my fate,</a>
<a NAME="0.29.5">Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</a>
<a NAME="0.29.6">Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.29.7">Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,</a>
<a NAME="0.29.8">With what I most enjoy contented least;</a>
<a NAME="0.29.9">Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,</a>
<a NAME="0.29.10">Haply I think on thee, and then my state,</a>
<a NAME="0.29.11">Like to the lark at break of day arising</a>
<a NAME="0.29.12">From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;</a>
<a NAME="0.29.13">  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings</a>
<a NAME="0.29.14">  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</a>
