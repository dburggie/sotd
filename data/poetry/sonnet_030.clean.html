<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.30.1">When to the sessions of sweet silent thought</a>
<a NAME="0.30.2">I summon up remembrance of things past,</a>
<a NAME="0.30.3">I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,</a>
<a NAME="0.30.4">And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:</a>
<a NAME="0.30.5">Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,</a>
<a NAME="0.30.6">For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,</a>
<a NAME="0.30.7">And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,</a>
<a NAME="0.30.8">And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:</a>
<a NAME="0.30.9">Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,</a>
<a NAME="0.30.10">And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er</a>
<a NAME="0.30.11">The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,</a>
<a NAME="0.30.12">Which I new pay as if not paid before.</a>
<a NAME="0.30.13">  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,</a>
<a NAME="0.30.14">  All losses are restored and sorrows end.</a>
