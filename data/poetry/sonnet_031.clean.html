<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.31.1">Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,</a>
<a NAME="0.31.2">Which I by lacking have supposed dead,</a>
<a NAME="0.31.3">And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,</a>
<a NAME="0.31.4">And all those friends which I thought buried.</a>
<a NAME="0.31.5">How many a holy and obsequious tear</a>
<a NAME="0.31.6">Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye</a>
<a NAME="0.31.7">As interest of the dead, which now appear</a>
<a NAME="0.31.8">But things removed that hidden in thee lie!</a>
<a NAME="0.31.9">Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,</a>
<a NAME="0.31.10">Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,</a>
<a NAME="0.31.11">Who all their parts of me to thee did give;</a>
<a NAME="0.31.12">That due of many now is thine alone:</a>
<a NAME="0.31.13">  Their images I loved I view in thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.31.14">  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.</a>
