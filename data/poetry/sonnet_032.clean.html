<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.32.1">If thou survive my well-contented day,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.2">When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.3">And shalt by fortune once more re-survey</a>
<a NAME="0.32.4">These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.5">Compare them with the bettering of the time,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.6">And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.7">Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.8">Exceeded by the height of happier men.</a>
<a NAME="0.32.9">O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:</a>
<a NAME="0.32.10">'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.11">A dearer birth than this his love had brought,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.12">To march in ranks of better equipage:</a>
<a NAME="0.32.13">  But since he died and poets better prove,</a>
<a NAME="0.32.14">  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'</a>
