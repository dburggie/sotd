<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.33.1">Full many a glorious morning have I seen</a>
<a NAME="0.33.2">Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,</a>
<a NAME="0.33.3">Kissing with golden face the meadows green,</a>
<a NAME="0.33.4">Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;</a>
<a NAME="0.33.5">Anon permit the basest clouds to ride</a>
<a NAME="0.33.6">With ugly rack on his celestial face,</a>
<a NAME="0.33.7">And from the forlorn world his visage hide,</a>
<a NAME="0.33.8">Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:</a>
<a NAME="0.33.9">Even so my sun one early morn did shine</a>
<a NAME="0.33.10">With all triumphant splendor on my brow;</a>
<a NAME="0.33.11">But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;</a>
<a NAME="0.33.12">The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.</a>
<a NAME="0.33.13">  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;</a>
<a NAME="0.33.14">  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.</a>
