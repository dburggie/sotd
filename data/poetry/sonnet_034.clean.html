<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.34.1">Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,</a>
<a NAME="0.34.2">And make me travel forth without my cloak,</a>
<a NAME="0.34.3">To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,</a>
<a NAME="0.34.4">Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?</a>
<a NAME="0.34.5">'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,</a>
<a NAME="0.34.6">To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,</a>
<a NAME="0.34.7">For no man well of such a salve can speak</a>
<a NAME="0.34.8">That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:</a>
<a NAME="0.34.9">Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;</a>
<a NAME="0.34.10">Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:</a>
<a NAME="0.34.11">The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief</a>
<a NAME="0.34.12">To him that bears the strong offence's cross.</a>
<a NAME="0.34.13">  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,</a>
<a NAME="0.34.14">  And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.</a>
