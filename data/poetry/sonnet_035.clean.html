<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.35.1">No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:</a>
<a NAME="0.35.2">Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;</a>
<a NAME="0.35.3">Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,</a>
<a NAME="0.35.4">And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.</a>
<a NAME="0.35.5">All men make faults, and even I in this,</a>
<a NAME="0.35.6">Authorizing thy trespass with compare,</a>
<a NAME="0.35.7">Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,</a>
<a NAME="0.35.8">Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;</a>
<a NAME="0.35.9">For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--</a>
<a NAME="0.35.10">Thy adverse party is thy advocate--</a>
<a NAME="0.35.11">And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:</a>
<a NAME="0.35.12">Such civil war is in my love and hate</a>
<a NAME="0.35.13">  That I an accessary needs must be</a>
<a NAME="0.35.14">  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.</a>
