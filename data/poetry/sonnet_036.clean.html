<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.36.1">Let me confess that we two must be twain,</a>
<a NAME="0.36.2">Although our undivided loves are one:</a>
<a NAME="0.36.3">So shall those blots that do with me remain</a>
<a NAME="0.36.4">Without thy help by me be borne alone.</a>
<a NAME="0.36.5">In our two loves there is but one respect,</a>
<a NAME="0.36.6">Though in our lives a separable spite,</a>
<a NAME="0.36.7">Which though it alter not love's sole effect,</a>
<a NAME="0.36.8">Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.</a>
<a NAME="0.36.9">I may not evermore acknowledge thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.36.10">Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,</a>
<a NAME="0.36.11">Nor thou with public kindness honour me,</a>
<a NAME="0.36.12">Unless thou take that honour from thy name:</a>
<a NAME="0.36.13">  But do not so; I love thee in such sort</a>
<a NAME="0.36.14">  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.</a>
