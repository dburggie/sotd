<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.37.1">As a decrepit father takes delight</a>
<a NAME="0.37.2">To see his active child do deeds of youth,</a>
<a NAME="0.37.3">So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,</a>
<a NAME="0.37.4">Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.</a>
<a NAME="0.37.5">For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,</a>
<a NAME="0.37.6">Or any of these all, or all, or more,</a>
<a NAME="0.37.7">Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,</a>
<a NAME="0.37.8">I make my love engrafted to this store:</a>
<a NAME="0.37.9">So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,</a>
<a NAME="0.37.10">Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give</a>
<a NAME="0.37.11">That I in thy abundance am sufficed</a>
<a NAME="0.37.12">And by a part of all thy glory live.</a>
<a NAME="0.37.13">  Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:</a>
<a NAME="0.37.14">  This wish I have; then ten times happy me!</a>
