<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.38.1">How can my Muse want subject to invent,</a>
<a NAME="0.38.2">While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse</a>
<a NAME="0.38.3">Thine own sweet argument, too excellent</a>
<a NAME="0.38.4">For every vulgar paper to rehearse?</a>
<a NAME="0.38.5">O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me</a>
<a NAME="0.38.6">Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;</a>
<a NAME="0.38.7">For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.38.8">When thou thyself dost give invention light?</a>
<a NAME="0.38.9">Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth</a>
<a NAME="0.38.10">Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;</a>
<a NAME="0.38.11">And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth</a>
<a NAME="0.38.12">Eternal numbers to outlive long date.</a>
<a NAME="0.38.13">  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,</a>
<a NAME="0.38.14">  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.</a>
