<a NAME="0.39.1">O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,</a>
<a NAME="0.39.2">When thou art all the better part of me?</a>
<a NAME="0.39.3">What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?</a>
<a NAME="0.39.4">And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?</a>
<a NAME="0.39.5">Even for this let us divided live,</a>
<a NAME="0.39.6">And our dear love lose name of single one,</a>
<a NAME="0.39.7">That by this separation I may give</a>
<a NAME="0.39.8">That due to thee which thou deservest alone.</a>
<a NAME="0.39.9">O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,</a>
<a NAME="0.39.10">Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave</a>
<a NAME="0.39.11">To entertain the time with thoughts of love,</a>
<a NAME="0.39.12">Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,</a>
<a NAME="0.39.13">  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,</a>
<a NAME="0.39.14">  By praising him here who doth hence remain!</a>
