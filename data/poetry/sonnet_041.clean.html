<a NAME="0.41.1">Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,</a>
<a NAME="0.41.2">When I am sometime absent from thy heart,</a>
<a NAME="0.41.3">Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,</a>
<a NAME="0.41.4">For still temptation follows where thou art.</a>
<a NAME="0.41.5">Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,</a>
<a NAME="0.41.6">Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;</a>
<a NAME="0.41.7">And when a woman woos, what woman's son</a>
<a NAME="0.41.8">Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?</a>
<a NAME="0.41.9">Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,</a>
<a NAME="0.41.10">And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,</a>
<a NAME="0.41.11">Who lead thee in their riot even there</a>
<a NAME="0.41.12">Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,</a>
<a NAME="0.41.13">  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.41.14">  Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.</a>
