<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.42.1">That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,</a>
<a NAME="0.42.2">And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;</a>
<a NAME="0.42.3">That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,</a>
<a NAME="0.42.4">A loss in love that touches me more nearly.</a>
<a NAME="0.42.5">Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:</a>
<a NAME="0.42.6">Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;</a>
<a NAME="0.42.7">And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,</a>
<a NAME="0.42.8">Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.</a>
<a NAME="0.42.9">If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,</a>
<a NAME="0.42.10">And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;</a>
<a NAME="0.42.11">Both find each other, and I lose both twain,</a>
<a NAME="0.42.12">And both for my sake lay on me this cross:</a>
<a NAME="0.42.13">  But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;</a>
<a NAME="0.42.14">  Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.</a>
