<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.44.1">If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,</a>
<a NAME="0.44.2">Injurious distance should not stop my way;</a>
<a NAME="0.44.3">For then despite of space I would be brought,</a>
<a NAME="0.44.4">From limits far remote where thou dost stay.</a>
<a NAME="0.44.5">No matter then although my foot did stand</a>
<a NAME="0.44.6">Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;</a>
<a NAME="0.44.7">For nimble thought can jump both sea and land</a>
<a NAME="0.44.8">As soon as think the place where he would be.</a>
<a NAME="0.44.9">But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,</a>
<a NAME="0.44.10">To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,</a>
<a NAME="0.44.11">But that so much of earth and water wrought</a>
<a NAME="0.44.12">I must attend time's leisure with my moan,</a>
<a NAME="0.44.13">  Receiving nought by elements so slow</a>
<a NAME="0.44.14">  But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.</a>
