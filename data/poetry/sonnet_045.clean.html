<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.45.1">The other two, slight air and purging fire,</a>
<a NAME="0.45.2">Are both with thee, wherever I abide;</a>
<a NAME="0.45.3">The first my thought, the other my desire,</a>
<a NAME="0.45.4">These present-absent with swift motion slide.</a>
<a NAME="0.45.5">For when these quicker elements are gone</a>
<a NAME="0.45.6">In tender embassy of love to thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.45.7">My life, being made of four, with two alone</a>
<a NAME="0.45.8">Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;</a>
<a NAME="0.45.9">Until life's composition be recured</a>
<a NAME="0.45.10">By those swift messengers return'd from thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.45.11">Who even but now come back again, assured</a>
<a NAME="0.45.12">Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:</a>
<a NAME="0.45.13">  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,</a>
<a NAME="0.45.14">  I send them back again and straight grow sad.</a>
