<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.46.1">Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war</a>
<a NAME="0.46.2">How to divide the conquest of thy sight;</a>
<a NAME="0.46.3">Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,</a>
<a NAME="0.46.4">My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.</a>
<a NAME="0.46.5">My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--</a>
<a NAME="0.46.6">A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--</a>
<a NAME="0.46.7">But the defendant doth that plea deny</a>
<a NAME="0.46.8">And says in him thy fair appearance lies.</a>
<a NAME="0.46.9">To 'cide this title is impanneled</a>
<a NAME="0.46.10">A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,</a>
<a NAME="0.46.11">And by their verdict is determined</a>
<a NAME="0.46.12">The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:</a>
<a NAME="0.46.13">  As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,</a>
<a NAME="0.46.14">  And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.</a>
