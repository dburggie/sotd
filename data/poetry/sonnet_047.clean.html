<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.47.1">Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,</a>
<a NAME="0.47.2">And each doth good turns now unto the other:</a>
<a NAME="0.47.3">When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,</a>
<a NAME="0.47.4">Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,</a>
<a NAME="0.47.5">With my love's picture then my eye doth feast</a>
<a NAME="0.47.6">And to the painted banquet bids my heart;</a>
<a NAME="0.47.7">Another time mine eye is my heart's guest</a>
<a NAME="0.47.8">And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:</a>
<a NAME="0.47.9">So, either by thy picture or my love,</a>
<a NAME="0.47.10">Thyself away art resent still with me;</a>
<a NAME="0.47.11">For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,</a>
<a NAME="0.47.12">And I am still with them and they with thee;</a>
<a NAME="0.47.13">  Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight</a>
<a NAME="0.47.14">  Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.</a>
