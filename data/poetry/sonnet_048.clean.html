<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.48.1">How careful was I, when I took my way,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.2">Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.3">That to my use it might unused stay</a>
<a NAME="0.48.4">From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!</a>
<a NAME="0.48.5">But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.6">Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.7">Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.8">Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.</a>
<a NAME="0.48.9">Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.10">Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.11">Within the gentle closure of my breast,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.12">From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;</a>
<a NAME="0.48.13">  And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,</a>
<a NAME="0.48.14">  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.</a>
