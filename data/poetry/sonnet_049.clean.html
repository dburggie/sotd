<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.49.1">Against that time, if ever that time come,</a>
<a NAME="0.49.2">When I shall see thee frown on my defects,</a>
<a NAME="0.49.3">When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,</a>
<a NAME="0.49.4">Call'd to that audit by advised respects;</a>
<a NAME="0.49.5">Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass</a>
<a NAME="0.49.6">And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,</a>
<a NAME="0.49.7">When love, converted from the thing it was,</a>
<a NAME="0.49.8">Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--</a>
<a NAME="0.49.9">Against that time do I ensconce me here</a>
<a NAME="0.49.10">Within the knowledge of mine own desert,</a>
<a NAME="0.49.11">And this my hand against myself uprear,</a>
<a NAME="0.49.12">To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:</a>
<a NAME="0.49.13">  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,</a>
<a NAME="0.49.14">  Since why to love I can allege no cause.</a>
