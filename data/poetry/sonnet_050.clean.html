<a NAME="0.50.1">How heavy do I journey on the way,</a>
<a NAME="0.50.2">When what I seek, my weary travel's end,</a>
<a NAME="0.50.3">Doth teach that ease and that repose to say</a>
<a NAME="0.50.4">'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'</a>
<a NAME="0.50.5">The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,</a>
<a NAME="0.50.6">Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,</a>
<a NAME="0.50.7">As if by some instinct the wretch did know</a>
<a NAME="0.50.8">His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:</a>
<a NAME="0.50.9">The bloody spur cannot provoke him on</a>
<a NAME="0.50.10">That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;</a>
<a NAME="0.50.11">Which heavily he answers with a groan,</a>
<a NAME="0.50.12">More sharp to me than spurring to his side;</a>
<a NAME="0.50.13">  For that same groan doth put this in my mind;</a>
<a NAME="0.50.14">  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.</a>
