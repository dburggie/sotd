<a NAME="0.51.1">Thus can my love excuse the slow offence</a>
<a NAME="0.51.2">Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:</a>
<a NAME="0.51.3">From where thou art why should I haste me thence?</a>
<a NAME="0.51.4">Till I return, of posting is no need.</a>
<a NAME="0.51.5">O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,</a>
<a NAME="0.51.6">When swift extremity can seem but slow?</a>
<a NAME="0.51.7">Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;</a>
<a NAME="0.51.8">In winged speed no motion shall I know:</a>
<a NAME="0.51.9">Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;</a>
<a NAME="0.51.10">Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,</a>
<a NAME="0.51.11">Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;</a>
<a NAME="0.51.12">But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;</a>
<a NAME="0.51.13">  Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,</a>
<a NAME="0.51.14">  Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.</a>
