<a NAME="0.52.1">So am I as the rich, whose blessed key</a>
<a NAME="0.52.2">Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.3">The which he will not every hour survey,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.4">For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.</a>
<a NAME="0.52.5">Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.6">Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.7">Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.8">Or captain jewels in the carcanet.</a>
<a NAME="0.52.9">So is the time that keeps you as my chest,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.10">Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.11">To make some special instant special blest,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.12">By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.</a>
<a NAME="0.52.13">  Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,</a>
<a NAME="0.52.14">  Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.</a>
