<a NAME="0.53.1">What is your substance, whereof are you made,</a>
<a NAME="0.53.2">That millions of strange shadows on you tend?</a>
<a NAME="0.53.3">Since every one hath, every one, one shade,</a>
<a NAME="0.53.4">And you, but one, can every shadow lend.</a>
<a NAME="0.53.5">Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit</a>
<a NAME="0.53.6">Is poorly imitated after you;</a>
<a NAME="0.53.7">On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,</a>
<a NAME="0.53.8">And you in Grecian tires are painted new:</a>
<a NAME="0.53.9">Speak of the spring and foison of the year;</a>
<a NAME="0.53.10">The one doth shadow of your beauty show,</a>
<a NAME="0.53.11">The other as your bounty doth appear;</a>
<a NAME="0.53.12">And you in every blessed shape we know.</a>
<a NAME="0.53.13">  In all external grace you have some part,</a>
<a NAME="0.53.14">  But you like none, none you, for constant heart.</a>
