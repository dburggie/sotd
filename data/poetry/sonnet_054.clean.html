<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.54.1">O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem</a>
<a NAME="0.54.2">By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!</a>
<a NAME="0.54.3">The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem</a>
<a NAME="0.54.4">For that sweet odour which doth in it live.</a>
<a NAME="0.54.5">The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye</a>
<a NAME="0.54.6">As the perfumed tincture of the roses,</a>
<a NAME="0.54.7">Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly</a>
<a NAME="0.54.8">When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:</a>
<a NAME="0.54.9">But, for their virtue only is their show,</a>
<a NAME="0.54.10">They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,</a>
<a NAME="0.54.11">Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;</a>
<a NAME="0.54.12">Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:</a>
<a NAME="0.54.13">  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,</a>
<a NAME="0.54.14">  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.</a>
