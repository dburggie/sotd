<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.56.1">Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said</a>
<a NAME="0.56.2">Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,</a>
<a NAME="0.56.3">Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.56.4">To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:</a>
<a NAME="0.56.5">So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill</a>
<a NAME="0.56.6">Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,</a>
<a NAME="0.56.7">To-morrow see again, and do not kill</a>
<a NAME="0.56.8">The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.</a>
<a NAME="0.56.9">Let this sad interim like the ocean be</a>
<a NAME="0.56.10">Which parts the shore, where two contracted new</a>
<a NAME="0.56.11">Come daily to the banks, that, when they see</a>
<a NAME="0.56.12">Return of love, more blest may be the view;</a>
<a NAME="0.56.13">  Else call it winter, which being full of care</a>
<a NAME="0.56.14">  Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.</a>
