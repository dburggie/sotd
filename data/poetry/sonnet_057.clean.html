<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.57.1">Being your slave, what should I do but tend</a>
<a NAME="0.57.2">Upon the hours and times of your desire?</a>
<a NAME="0.57.3">I have no precious time at all to spend,</a>
<a NAME="0.57.4">Nor services to do, till you require.</a>
<a NAME="0.57.5">Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour</a>
<a NAME="0.57.6">Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,</a>
<a NAME="0.57.7">Nor think the bitterness of absence sour</a>
<a NAME="0.57.8">When you have bid your servant once adieu;</a>
<a NAME="0.57.9">Nor dare I question with my jealous thought</a>
<a NAME="0.57.10">Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,</a>
<a NAME="0.57.11">But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought</a>
<a NAME="0.57.12">Save, where you are how happy you make those.</a>
<a NAME="0.57.13">  So true a fool is love that in your will,</a>
<a NAME="0.57.14">  Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.</a>
