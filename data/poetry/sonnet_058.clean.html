<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.58.1">That god forbid that made me first your slave,</a>
<a NAME="0.58.2">I should in thought control your times of pleasure,</a>
<a NAME="0.58.3">Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,</a>
<a NAME="0.58.4">Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!</a>
<a NAME="0.58.5">O, let me suffer, being at your beck,</a>
<a NAME="0.58.6">The imprison'd absence of your liberty;</a>
<a NAME="0.58.7">And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,</a>
<a NAME="0.58.8">Without accusing you of injury.</a>
<a NAME="0.58.9">Be where you list, your charter is so strong</a>
<a NAME="0.58.10">That you yourself may privilege your time</a>
<a NAME="0.58.11">To what you will; to you it doth belong</a>
<a NAME="0.58.12">Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.</a>
<a NAME="0.58.13">  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;</a>
<a NAME="0.58.14">  Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.</a>
