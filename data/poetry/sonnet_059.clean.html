<a NAME="0.59.1">If there be nothing new, but that which is</a>
<a NAME="0.59.2">Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,</a>
<a NAME="0.59.3">Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss</a>
<a NAME="0.59.4">The second burden of a former child!</a>
<a NAME="0.59.5">O, that record could with a backward look,</a>
<a NAME="0.59.6">Even of five hundred courses of the sun,</a>
<a NAME="0.59.7">Show me your image in some antique book,</a>
<a NAME="0.59.8">Since mind at first in character was done!</a>
<a NAME="0.59.9">That I might see what the old world could say</a>
<a NAME="0.59.10">To this composed wonder of your frame;</a>
<a NAME="0.59.11">Whether we are mended, or whether better they,</a>
<a NAME="0.59.12">Or whether revolution be the same.</a>
<a NAME="0.59.13">  O, sure I am, the wits of former days</a>
<a NAME="0.59.14">  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.</a>
