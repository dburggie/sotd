<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.60.1">Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,</a>
<a NAME="0.60.2">So do our minutes hasten to their end;</a>
<a NAME="0.60.3">Each changing place with that which goes before,</a>
<a NAME="0.60.4">In sequent toil all forwards do contend.</a>
<a NAME="0.60.5">Nativity, once in the main of light,</a>
<a NAME="0.60.6">Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.60.7">Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,</a>
<a NAME="0.60.8">And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.</a>
<a NAME="0.60.9">Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth</a>
<a NAME="0.60.10">And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,</a>
<a NAME="0.60.11">Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,</a>
<a NAME="0.60.12">And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:</a>
<a NAME="0.60.13">  And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,</a>
<a NAME="0.60.14">  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.</a>
