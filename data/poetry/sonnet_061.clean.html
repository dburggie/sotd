<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.61.1">Is it thy will thy image should keep open</a>
<a NAME="0.61.2">My heavy eyelids to the weary night?</a>
<a NAME="0.61.3">Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,</a>
<a NAME="0.61.4">While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?</a>
<a NAME="0.61.5">Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee</a>
<a NAME="0.61.6">So far from home into my deeds to pry,</a>
<a NAME="0.61.7">To find out shames and idle hours in me,</a>
<a NAME="0.61.8">The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?</a>
<a NAME="0.61.9">O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:</a>
<a NAME="0.61.10">It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;</a>
<a NAME="0.61.11">Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,</a>
<a NAME="0.61.12">To play the watchman ever for thy sake:</a>
<a NAME="0.61.13">  For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,</a>
<a NAME="0.61.14">  From me far off, with others all too near.</a>
