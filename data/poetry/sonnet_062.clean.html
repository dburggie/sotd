<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.62.1">Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye</a>
<a NAME="0.62.2">And all my soul and all my every part;</a>
<a NAME="0.62.3">And for this sin there is no remedy,</a>
<a NAME="0.62.4">It is so grounded inward in my heart.</a>
<a NAME="0.62.5">Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,</a>
<a NAME="0.62.6">No shape so true, no truth of such account;</a>
<a NAME="0.62.7">And for myself mine own worth do define,</a>
<a NAME="0.62.8">As I all other in all worths surmount.</a>
<a NAME="0.62.9">But when my glass shows me myself indeed,</a>
<a NAME="0.62.10">Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,</a>
<a NAME="0.62.11">Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;</a>
<a NAME="0.62.12">Self so self-loving were iniquity.</a>
<a NAME="0.62.13">  'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,</a>
<a NAME="0.62.14">  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.</a>
