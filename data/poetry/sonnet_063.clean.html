<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.63.1">Against my love shall be, as I am now,</a>
<a NAME="0.63.2">With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;</a>
<a NAME="0.63.3">When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow</a>
<a NAME="0.63.4">With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn</a>
<a NAME="0.63.5">Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,</a>
<a NAME="0.63.6">And all those beauties whereof now he's king</a>
<a NAME="0.63.7">Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,</a>
<a NAME="0.63.8">Stealing away the treasure of his spring;</a>
<a NAME="0.63.9">For such a time do I now fortify</a>
<a NAME="0.63.10">Against confounding age's cruel knife,</a>
<a NAME="0.63.11">That he shall never cut from memory</a>
<a NAME="0.63.12">My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:</a>
<a NAME="0.63.13">  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,</a>
<a NAME="0.63.14">  And they shall live, and he in them still green.</a>
