<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.64.1">When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced</a>
<a NAME="0.64.2">The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;</a>
<a NAME="0.64.3">When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed</a>
<a NAME="0.64.4">And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;</a>
<a NAME="0.64.5">When I have seen the hungry ocean gain</a>
<a NAME="0.64.6">Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,</a>
<a NAME="0.64.7">And the firm soil win of the watery main,</a>
<a NAME="0.64.8">Increasing store with loss and loss with store;</a>
<a NAME="0.64.9">When I have seen such interchange of state,</a>
<a NAME="0.64.10">Or state itself confounded to decay;</a>
<a NAME="0.64.11">Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,</a>
<a NAME="0.64.12">That Time will come and take my love away.</a>
<a NAME="0.64.13">  This thought is as a death, which cannot choose</a>
<a NAME="0.64.14">  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.</a>
