<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.65.1">Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,</a>
<a NAME="0.65.2">But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,</a>
<a NAME="0.65.3">How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,</a>
<a NAME="0.65.4">Whose action is no stronger than a flower?</a>
<a NAME="0.65.5">O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out</a>
<a NAME="0.65.6">Against the wreckful siege of battering days,</a>
<a NAME="0.65.7">When rocks impregnable are not so stout,</a>
<a NAME="0.65.8">Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?</a>
<a NAME="0.65.9">O fearful meditation! where, alack,</a>
<a NAME="0.65.10">Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?</a>
<a NAME="0.65.11">Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?</a>
<a NAME="0.65.12">Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?</a>
<a NAME="0.65.13">  O, none, unless this miracle have might,</a>
<a NAME="0.65.14">  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.</a>
