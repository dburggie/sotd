<a NAME="0.67.1">Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,</a>
<a NAME="0.67.2">And with his presence grace impiety,</a>
<a NAME="0.67.3">That sin by him advantage should achieve</a>
<a NAME="0.67.4">And lace itself with his society?</a>
<a NAME="0.67.5">Why should false painting imitate his cheek</a>
<a NAME="0.67.6">And steal dead seeing of his living hue?</a>
<a NAME="0.67.7">Why should poor beauty indirectly seek</a>
<a NAME="0.67.8">Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?</a>
<a NAME="0.67.9">Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,</a>
<a NAME="0.67.10">Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?</a>
<a NAME="0.67.11">For she hath no exchequer now but his,</a>
<a NAME="0.67.12">And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.</a>
<a NAME="0.67.13">  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had</a>
<a NAME="0.67.14">  In days long since, before these last so bad.</a>
