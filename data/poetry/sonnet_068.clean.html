<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.68.1">Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.2">When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.3">Before the bastard signs of fair were born,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.4">Or durst inhabit on a living brow;</a>
<a NAME="0.68.5">Before the golden tresses of the dead,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.6">The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.7">To live a second life on second head;</a>
<a NAME="0.68.8">Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:</a>
<a NAME="0.68.9">In him those holy antique hours are seen,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.10">Without all ornament, itself and true,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.11">Making no summer of another's green,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.12">Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;</a>
<a NAME="0.68.13">  And him as for a map doth Nature store,</a>
<a NAME="0.68.14">  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.</a>
