<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.69.1">Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view</a>
<a NAME="0.69.2">Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;</a>
<a NAME="0.69.3">All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,</a>
<a NAME="0.69.4">Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.</a>
<a NAME="0.69.5">Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;</a>
<a NAME="0.69.6">But those same tongues that give thee so thine own</a>
<a NAME="0.69.7">In other accents do this praise confound</a>
<a NAME="0.69.8">By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.</a>
<a NAME="0.69.9">They look into the beauty of thy mind,</a>
<a NAME="0.69.10">And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;</a>
<a NAME="0.69.11">Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,</a>
<a NAME="0.69.12">To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:</a>
<a NAME="0.69.13">  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,</a>
<a NAME="0.69.14">  The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.</a>
