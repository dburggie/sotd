<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.70.1">That thou are blam'd shall not be thy defect,</a>
<a NAME="0.70.2">For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;</a>
<a NAME="0.70.3">the ornament of beauty is suspect,</a>
<a NAME="0.70.4">A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.</a>
<a NAME="0.70.5">So thou be good, slander doth but approve</a>
<a NAME="0.70.6">Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time,</a>
<a NAME="0.70.7">For canker vice the sweetest bud doth love,</a>
<a NAME="0.70.8">And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.</a>
<a NAME="0.70.9">Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,</a>
<a NAME="0.70.10">Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.70.11">Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise</a>
<a NAME="0.70.12">To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd:</a>
<a NAME="0.70.13">  If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,</a>
<a NAME="0.70.14">  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.</a>
