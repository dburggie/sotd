<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.71.1">No longer mourn for me when I am dead</a>
<a NAME="0.71.2">Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell</a>
<a NAME="0.71.3">Give warning to the world that I am fled</a>
<a NAME="0.71.4">From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:</a>
<a NAME="0.71.5">Nay, if you read this line, remember not</a>
<a NAME="0.71.6">The hand that writ it; for I love you so</a>
<a NAME="0.71.7">That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot</a>
<a NAME="0.71.8">If thinking on me then should make you woe.</a>
<a NAME="0.71.9">O, if, I say, you look upon this verse</a>
<a NAME="0.71.10">When I perhaps compounded am with clay,</a>
<a NAME="0.71.11">Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.</a>
<a NAME="0.71.12">But let your love even with my life decay,</a>
<a NAME="0.71.13">  Lest the wise world should look into your moan</a>
<a NAME="0.71.14">  And mock you with me after I am gone.</a>
