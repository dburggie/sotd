<h1>Sonnet LXXI</h1>

<blockquote>No longer mourn for me when I am dead<br>
Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell<br>
Give warning to the world that I am fled<br>
From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:<br>
Nay, if you read this line, remember not<br>
The hand that writ it; for I love you so<br>
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot<br>
If thinking on me then should make you woe.<br>
O, if, I say, you look upon this verse<br>
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,<br>
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.<br>
But let your love even with my life decay,<br>
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan<br>
  And mock you with me after I am gone.<br>
</blockquote>
