<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.72.1">O, lest the world should task you to recite</a>
<a NAME="0.72.2">What merit lived in me, that you should love</a>
<a NAME="0.72.3">After my death, dear love, forget me quite,</a>
<a NAME="0.72.4">For you in me can nothing worthy prove;</a>
<a NAME="0.72.5">Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,</a>
<a NAME="0.72.6">To do more for me than mine own desert,</a>
<a NAME="0.72.7">And hang more praise upon deceased I</a>
<a NAME="0.72.8">Than niggard truth would willingly impart:</a>
<a NAME="0.72.9">O, lest your true love may seem false in this,</a>
<a NAME="0.72.10">That you for love speak well of me untrue,</a>
<a NAME="0.72.11">My name be buried where my body is,</a>
<a NAME="0.72.12">And live no more to shame nor me nor you.</a>
<a NAME="0.72.13">  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,</a>
<a NAME="0.72.14">  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.</a>
