<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.73.1">That time of year thou mayst in me behold</a>
<a NAME="0.73.2">When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang</a>
<a NAME="0.73.3">Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,</a>
<a NAME="0.73.4">Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.</a>
<a NAME="0.73.5">In me thou seest the twilight of such day</a>
<a NAME="0.73.6">As after sunset fadeth in the west,</a>
<a NAME="0.73.7">Which by and by black night doth take away,</a>
<a NAME="0.73.8">Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.</a>
<a NAME="0.73.9">In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire</a>
<a NAME="0.73.10">That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,</a>
<a NAME="0.73.11">As the death-bed whereon it must expire</a>
<a NAME="0.73.12">Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.</a>
<a NAME="0.73.13">  This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,</a>
<a NAME="0.73.14">  To love that well which thou must leave ere long.</a>
