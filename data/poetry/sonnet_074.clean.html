<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.74.1">But be contented: when that fell arrest</a>
<a NAME="0.74.2">Without all bail shall carry me away,</a>
<a NAME="0.74.3">My life hath in this line some interest,</a>
<a NAME="0.74.4">Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.</a>
<a NAME="0.74.5">When thou reviewest this, thou dost review</a>
<a NAME="0.74.6">The very part was consecrate to thee:</a>
<a NAME="0.74.7">The earth can have but earth, which is his due;</a>
<a NAME="0.74.8">My spirit is thine, the better part of me:</a>
<a NAME="0.74.9">So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,</a>
<a NAME="0.74.10">The prey of worms, my body being dead,</a>
<a NAME="0.74.11">The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,</a>
<a NAME="0.74.12">Too base of thee to be remembered.</a>
<a NAME="0.74.13">  The worth of that is that which it contains,</a>
<a NAME="0.74.14">  And that is this, and this with thee remains.</a>
