<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.75.1">So are you to my thoughts as food to life,</a>
<a NAME="0.75.2">Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;</a>
<a NAME="0.75.3">And for the peace of you I hold such strife</a>
<a NAME="0.75.4">As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;</a>
<a NAME="0.75.5">Now proud as an enjoyer and anon</a>
<a NAME="0.75.6">Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,</a>
<a NAME="0.75.7">Now counting best to be with you alone,</a>
<a NAME="0.75.8">Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;</a>
<a NAME="0.75.9">Sometime all full with feasting on your sight</a>
<a NAME="0.75.10">And by and by clean starved for a look;</a>
<a NAME="0.75.11">Possessing or pursuing no delight,</a>
<a NAME="0.75.12">Save what is had or must from you be took.</a>
<a NAME="0.75.13">  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,</a>
<a NAME="0.75.14">  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.</a>
