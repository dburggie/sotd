<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.76.1">Why is my verse so barren of new pride,</a>
<a NAME="0.76.2">So far from variation or quick change?</a>
<a NAME="0.76.3">Why with the time do I not glance aside</a>
<a NAME="0.76.4">To new-found methods and to compounds strange?</a>
<a NAME="0.76.5">Why write I still all one, ever the same,</a>
<a NAME="0.76.6">And keep invention in a noted weed,</a>
<a NAME="0.76.7">That every word doth almost tell my name,</a>
<a NAME="0.76.8">Showing their birth and where they did proceed?</a>
<a NAME="0.76.9">O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,</a>
<a NAME="0.76.10">And you and love are still my argument;</a>
<a NAME="0.76.11">So all my best is dressing old words new,</a>
<a NAME="0.76.12">Spending again what is already spent:</a>
<a NAME="0.76.13">  For as the sun is daily new and old,</a>
<a NAME="0.76.14">  So is my love still telling what is told.</a>
