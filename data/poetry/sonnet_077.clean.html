<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.77.1">Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,</a>
<a NAME="0.77.2">Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;</a>
<a NAME="0.77.3">The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,</a>
<a NAME="0.77.4">And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.</a>
<a NAME="0.77.5">The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show</a>
<a NAME="0.77.6">Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;</a>
<a NAME="0.77.7">Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know</a>
<a NAME="0.77.8">Time's thievish progress to eternity.</a>
<a NAME="0.77.9">Look, what thy memory can not contain</a>
<a NAME="0.77.10">Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find</a>
<a NAME="0.77.11">Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,</a>
<a NAME="0.77.12">To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.</a>
<a NAME="0.77.13">  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,</a>
<a NAME="0.77.14">  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.</a>
