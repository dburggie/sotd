<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.78.1">So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse</a>
<a NAME="0.78.2">And found such fair assistance in my verse</a>
<a NAME="0.78.3">As every alien pen hath got my use</a>
<a NAME="0.78.4">And under thee their poesy disperse.</a>
<a NAME="0.78.5">Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing</a>
<a NAME="0.78.6">And heavy ignorance aloft to fly</a>
<a NAME="0.78.7">Have added feathers to the learned's wing</a>
<a NAME="0.78.8">And given grace a double majesty.</a>
<a NAME="0.78.9">Yet be most proud of that which I compile,</a>
<a NAME="0.78.10">Whose influence is thine and born of thee:</a>
<a NAME="0.78.11">In others' works thou dost but mend the style,</a>
<a NAME="0.78.12">And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;</a>
<a NAME="0.78.13">  But thou art all my art and dost advance</a>
<a NAME="0.78.14">  As high as learning my rude ignorance.</a>
