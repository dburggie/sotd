<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.79.1">Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,</a>
<a NAME="0.79.2">My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,</a>
<a NAME="0.79.3">But now my gracious numbers are decay'd</a>
<a NAME="0.79.4">And my sick Muse doth give another place.</a>
<a NAME="0.79.5">I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument</a>
<a NAME="0.79.6">Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,</a>
<a NAME="0.79.7">Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent</a>
<a NAME="0.79.8">He robs thee of and pays it thee again.</a>
<a NAME="0.79.9">He lends thee virtue and he stole that word</a>
<a NAME="0.79.10">From thy behavior; beauty doth he give</a>
<a NAME="0.79.11">And found it in thy cheek; he can afford</a>
<a NAME="0.79.12">No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.</a>
<a NAME="0.79.13">  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,</a>
<a NAME="0.79.14">  Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.</a>
