<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.80.1">O, how I faint when I of you do write,</a>
<a NAME="0.80.2">Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,</a>
<a NAME="0.80.3">And in the praise thereof spends all his might,</a>
<a NAME="0.80.4">To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!</a>
<a NAME="0.80.5">But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,</a>
<a NAME="0.80.6">The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,</a>
<a NAME="0.80.7">My saucy bark inferior far to his</a>
<a NAME="0.80.8">On your broad main doth wilfully appear.</a>
<a NAME="0.80.9">Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,</a>
<a NAME="0.80.10">Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;</a>
<a NAME="0.80.11">Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,</a>
<a NAME="0.80.12">He of tall building and of goodly pride:</a>
<a NAME="0.80.13">  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,</a>
<a NAME="0.80.14">  The worst was this; my love was my decay.</a>
