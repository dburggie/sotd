<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.82.1">I grant thou wert not married to my Muse</a>
<a NAME="0.82.2">And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook</a>
<a NAME="0.82.3">The dedicated words which writers use</a>
<a NAME="0.82.4">Of their fair subject, blessing every book</a>
<a NAME="0.82.5">Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,</a>
<a NAME="0.82.6">Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,</a>
<a NAME="0.82.7">And therefore art enforced to seek anew</a>
<a NAME="0.82.8">Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days</a>
<a NAME="0.82.9">And do so, love; yet when they have devised</a>
<a NAME="0.82.10">What strained touches rhetoric can lend,</a>
<a NAME="0.82.11">Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized</a>
<a NAME="0.82.12">In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;</a>
<a NAME="0.82.13">  And their gross painting might be better used</a>
<a NAME="0.82.14">  Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.</a>
