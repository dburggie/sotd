<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.83.1">I never saw that you did painting need</a>
<a NAME="0.83.2">And therefore to your fair no painting set;</a>
<a NAME="0.83.3">I found, or thought I found, you did exceed</a>
<a NAME="0.83.4">The barren tender of a poet's debt;</a>
<a NAME="0.83.5">And therefore have I slept in your report,</a>
<a NAME="0.83.6">That you yourself being extant well might show</a>
<a NAME="0.83.7">How far a modern quill doth come too short,</a>
<a NAME="0.83.8">Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.</a>
<a NAME="0.83.9">This silence for my sin you did impute,</a>
<a NAME="0.83.10">Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;</a>
<a NAME="0.83.11">For I impair not beauty being mute,</a>
<a NAME="0.83.12">When others would give life and bring a tomb.</a>
<a NAME="0.83.13">  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes</a>
<a NAME="0.83.14">  Than both your poets can in praise devise.</a>
