<a NAME="0.84.1">Who is it that says most? which can say more</a>
<a NAME="0.84.2">Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?</a>
<a NAME="0.84.3">In whose confine immured is the store</a>
<a NAME="0.84.4">Which should example where your equal grew.</a>
<a NAME="0.84.5">Lean penury within that pen doth dwell</a>
<a NAME="0.84.6">That to his subject lends not some small glory;</a>
<a NAME="0.84.7">But he that writes of you, if he can tell</a>
<a NAME="0.84.8">That you are you, so dignifies his story,</a>
<a NAME="0.84.9">Let him but copy what in you is writ,</a>
<a NAME="0.84.10">Not making worse what nature made so clear,</a>
<a NAME="0.84.11">And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,</a>
<a NAME="0.84.12">Making his style admired every where.</a>
<a NAME="0.84.13">  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,</a>
<a NAME="0.84.14">  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.</a>
