<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.85.1">My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,</a>
<a NAME="0.85.2">While comments of your praise, richly compiled,</a>
<a NAME="0.85.3">Reserve their character with golden quill</a>
<a NAME="0.85.4">And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.</a>
<a NAME="0.85.5">I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,</a>
<a NAME="0.85.6">And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'</a>
<a NAME="0.85.7">To every hymn that able spirit affords</a>
<a NAME="0.85.8">In polish'd form of well-refined pen.</a>
<a NAME="0.85.9">Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'</a>
<a NAME="0.85.10">And to the most of praise add something more;</a>
<a NAME="0.85.11">But that is in my thought, whose love to you,</a>
<a NAME="0.85.12">Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.</a>
<a NAME="0.85.13">  Then others for the breath of words respect,</a>
<a NAME="0.85.14">  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.</a>
