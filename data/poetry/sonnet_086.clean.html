<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.86.1">Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,</a>
<a NAME="0.86.2">Bound for the prize of all too precious you,</a>
<a NAME="0.86.3">That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,</a>
<a NAME="0.86.4">Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?</a>
<a NAME="0.86.5">Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write</a>
<a NAME="0.86.6">Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?</a>
<a NAME="0.86.7">No, neither he, nor his compeers by night</a>
<a NAME="0.86.8">Giving him aid, my verse astonished.</a>
<a NAME="0.86.9">He, nor that affable familiar ghost</a>
<a NAME="0.86.10">Which nightly gulls him with intelligence</a>
<a NAME="0.86.11">As victors of my silence cannot boast;</a>
<a NAME="0.86.12">I was not sick of any fear from thence:</a>
<a NAME="0.86.13">  But when your countenance fill'd up his line,</a>
<a NAME="0.86.14">  Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.</a>
