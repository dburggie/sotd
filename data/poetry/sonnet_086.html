<h1>Sonnet LXXXVI</h1>

<blockquote>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,<br>
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,<br>
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,<br>
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?<br>
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write<br>
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?<br>
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night<br>
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.<br>
He, nor that affable familiar ghost<br>
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence<br>
As victors of my silence cannot boast;<br>
I was not sick of any fear from thence:<br>
  But when your countenance fill'd up his line,<br>
  Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.<br>
