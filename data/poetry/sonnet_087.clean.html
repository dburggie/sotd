<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.87.1">Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,</a>
<a NAME="0.87.2">And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:</a>
<a NAME="0.87.3">The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;</a>
<a NAME="0.87.4">My bonds in thee are all determinate.</a>
<a NAME="0.87.5">For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?</a>
<a NAME="0.87.6">And for that riches where is my deserving?</a>
<a NAME="0.87.7">The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,</a>
<a NAME="0.87.8">And so my patent back again is swerving.</a>
<a NAME="0.87.9">Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,</a>
<a NAME="0.87.10">Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;</a>
<a NAME="0.87.11">So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,</a>
<a NAME="0.87.12">Comes home again, on better judgment making.</a>
<a NAME="0.87.13">  Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,</a>
<a NAME="0.87.14">  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.</a>
