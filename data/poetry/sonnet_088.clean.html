<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.88.1">When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,</a>
<a NAME="0.88.2">And place my merit in the eye of scorn,</a>
<a NAME="0.88.3">Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,</a>
<a NAME="0.88.4">And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.</a>
<a NAME="0.88.5">With mine own weakness being best acquainted,</a>
<a NAME="0.88.6">Upon thy part I can set down a story</a>
<a NAME="0.88.7">Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,</a>
<a NAME="0.88.8">That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:</a>
<a NAME="0.88.9">And I by this will be a gainer too;</a>
<a NAME="0.88.10">For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.88.11">The injuries that to myself I do,</a>
<a NAME="0.88.12">Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.</a>
<a NAME="0.88.13">  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,</a>
<a NAME="0.88.14">  That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.</a>
