<a NAME="0.90.1">Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;</a>
<a NAME="0.90.2">Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,</a>
<a NAME="0.90.3">Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,</a>
<a NAME="0.90.4">And do not drop in for an after-loss:</a>
<a NAME="0.90.5">Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,</a>
<a NAME="0.90.6">Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;</a>
<a NAME="0.90.7">Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,</a>
<a NAME="0.90.8">To linger out a purposed overthrow.</a>
<a NAME="0.90.9">If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,</a>
<a NAME="0.90.10">When other petty griefs have done their spite</a>
<a NAME="0.90.11">But in the onset come; so shall I taste</a>
<a NAME="0.90.12">At first the very worst of fortune's might,</a>
<a NAME="0.90.13">  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,</a>
<a NAME="0.90.14">  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.</a>
