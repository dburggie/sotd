<a NAME="0.91.1">Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,</a>
<a NAME="0.91.2">Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,</a>
<a NAME="0.91.3">Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,</a>
<a NAME="0.91.4">Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;</a>
<a NAME="0.91.5">And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,</a>
<a NAME="0.91.6">Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:</a>
<a NAME="0.91.7">But these particulars are not my measure;</a>
<a NAME="0.91.8">All these I better in one general best.</a>
<a NAME="0.91.9">Thy love is better than high birth to me,</a>
<a NAME="0.91.10">Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,</a>
<a NAME="0.91.11">Of more delight than hawks or horses be;</a>
<a NAME="0.91.12">And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:</a>
<a NAME="0.91.13">  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take</a>
<a NAME="0.91.14">  All this away and me most wretched make.</a>
