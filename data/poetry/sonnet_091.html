<h1>Sonnet XCI</h1>

<blockquote>Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,<br>
Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,<br>
Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,<br>
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;<br>
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,<br>
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:<br>
But these particulars are not my measure;<br>
All these I better in one general best.<br>
Thy love is better than high birth to me,<br>
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,<br>
Of more delight than hawks or horses be;<br>
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:<br>
  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take<br>
  All this away and me most wretched make.<br>
