<a NAME="0.92.1">But do thy worst to steal thyself away,</a>
<a NAME="0.92.2">For term of life thou art assured mine,</a>
<a NAME="0.92.3">And life no longer than thy love will stay,</a>
<a NAME="0.92.4">For it depends upon that love of thine.</a>
<a NAME="0.92.5">Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,</a>
<a NAME="0.92.6">When in the least of them my life hath end.</a>
<a NAME="0.92.7">I see a better state to me belongs</a>
<a NAME="0.92.8">Than that which on thy humour doth depend;</a>
<a NAME="0.92.9">Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,</a>
<a NAME="0.92.10">Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.</a>
<a NAME="0.92.11">O, what a happy title do I find,</a>
<a NAME="0.92.12">Happy to have thy love, happy to die!</a>
<a NAME="0.92.13">  But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?</a>
<a NAME="0.92.14">  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.</a>
