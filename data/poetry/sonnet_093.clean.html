<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.93.1">So shall I live, supposing thou art true,</a>
<a NAME="0.93.2">Like a deceived husband; so love's face</a>
<a NAME="0.93.3">May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;</a>
<a NAME="0.93.4">Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:</a>
<a NAME="0.93.5">For there can live no hatred in thine eye,</a>
<a NAME="0.93.6">Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.</a>
<a NAME="0.93.7">In many's looks the false heart's history</a>
<a NAME="0.93.8">Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,</a>
<a NAME="0.93.9">But heaven in thy creation did decree</a>
<a NAME="0.93.10">That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;</a>
<a NAME="0.93.11">Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,</a>
<a NAME="0.93.12">Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.</a>
<a NAME="0.93.13">  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,</a>
<a NAME="0.93.14">  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!</a>
