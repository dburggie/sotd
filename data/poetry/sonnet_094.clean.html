<a NAME="0.94.1">They that have power to hurt and will do none,</a>
<a NAME="0.94.2">That do not do the thing they most do show,</a>
<a NAME="0.94.3">Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,</a>
<a NAME="0.94.4">Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,</a>
<a NAME="0.94.5">They rightly do inherit heaven's graces</a>
<a NAME="0.94.6">And husband nature's riches from expense;</a>
<a NAME="0.94.7">They are the lords and owners of their faces,</a>
<a NAME="0.94.8">Others but stewards of their excellence.</a>
<a NAME="0.94.9">The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,</a>
<a NAME="0.94.10">Though to itself it only live and die,</a>
<a NAME="0.94.11">But if that flower with base infection meet,</a>
<a NAME="0.94.12">The basest weed outbraves his dignity:</a>
<a NAME="0.94.13">  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;</a>
<a NAME="0.94.14">  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.</a>
