<a NAME="0.95.1">How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame</a>
<a NAME="0.95.2">Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,</a>
<a NAME="0.95.3">Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!</a>
<a NAME="0.95.4">O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!</a>
<a NAME="0.95.5">That tongue that tells the story of thy days,</a>
<a NAME="0.95.6">Making lascivious comments on thy sport,</a>
<a NAME="0.95.7">Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;</a>
<a NAME="0.95.8">Naming thy name blesses an ill report.</a>
<a NAME="0.95.9">O, what a mansion have those vices got</a>
<a NAME="0.95.10">Which for their habitation chose out thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.95.11">Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,</a>
<a NAME="0.95.12">And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!</a>
<a NAME="0.95.13">  Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;</a>
<a NAME="0.95.14">  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.</a>
