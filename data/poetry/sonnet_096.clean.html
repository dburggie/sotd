<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.96.1">Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;</a>
<a NAME="0.96.2">Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;</a>
<a NAME="0.96.3">Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;</a>
<a NAME="0.96.4">Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.</a>
<a NAME="0.96.5">As on the finger of a throned queen</a>
<a NAME="0.96.6">The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.96.7">So are those errors that in thee are seen</a>
<a NAME="0.96.8">To truths translated and for true things deem'd.</a>
<a NAME="0.96.9">How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,</a>
<a NAME="0.96.10">If like a lamb he could his looks translate!</a>
<a NAME="0.96.11">How many gazers mightst thou lead away,</a>
<a NAME="0.96.12">If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!</a>
<a NAME="0.96.13">  But do not so; I love thee in such sort</a>
<a NAME="0.96.14">  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.</a>
