<h1>Sonnet XCVI</h1>

<blockquote>Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;<br>
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;<br>
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;<br>
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.<br>
As on the finger of a throned queen<br>
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,<br>
So are those errors that in thee are seen<br>
To truths translated and for true things deem'd.<br>
How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,<br>
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!<br>
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,<br>
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!<br>
  But do not so; I love thee in such sort<br>
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<br>
