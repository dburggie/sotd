<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.97.1">How like a winter hath my absence been</a>
<a NAME="0.97.2">From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!</a>
<a NAME="0.97.3">What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!</a>
<a NAME="0.97.4">What old December's bareness every where!</a>
<a NAME="0.97.5">And yet this time removed was summer's time,</a>
<a NAME="0.97.6">The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,</a>
<a NAME="0.97.7">Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,</a>
<a NAME="0.97.8">Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:</a>
<a NAME="0.97.9">Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me</a>
<a NAME="0.97.10">But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;</a>
<a NAME="0.97.11">For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.97.12">And, thou away, the very birds are mute;</a>
<a NAME="0.97.13">  Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer</a>
<a NAME="0.97.14">  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.</a>
