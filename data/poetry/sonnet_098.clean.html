<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.98.1">From you have I been absent in the spring,</a>
<a NAME="0.98.2">When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim</a>
<a NAME="0.98.3">Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,</a>
<a NAME="0.98.4">That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.</a>
<a NAME="0.98.5">Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell</a>
<a NAME="0.98.6">Of different flowers in odour and in hue</a>
<a NAME="0.98.7">Could make me any summer's story tell,</a>
<a NAME="0.98.8">Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;</a>
<a NAME="0.98.9">Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,</a>
<a NAME="0.98.10">Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;</a>
<a NAME="0.98.11">They were but sweet, but figures of delight,</a>
<a NAME="0.98.12">Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.</a>
<a NAME="0.98.13">  Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,</a>
<a NAME="0.98.14">  As with your shadow I with these did play:</a>
