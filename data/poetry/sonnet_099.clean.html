<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.99.1">The forward violet thus did I chide:</a>
<a NAME="0.99.2">Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,</a>
<a NAME="0.99.3">If not from my love's breath? The purple pride</a>
<a NAME="0.99.4">Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells</a>
<a NAME="0.99.5">In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.</a>
<a NAME="0.99.6">The lily I condemned for thy hand,</a>
<a NAME="0.99.7">And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:</a>
<a NAME="0.99.8">The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,</a>
<a NAME="0.99.9">One blushing shame, another white despair;</a>
<a NAME="0.99.10">A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both</a>
<a NAME="0.99.11">And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;</a>
<a NAME="0.99.12">But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth</a>
<a NAME="0.99.13">A vengeful canker eat him up to death.</a>
<a NAME="0.99.14">  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see</a>
<a NAME="0.99.15">  But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.</a>
