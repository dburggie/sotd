<a NAME="0.101.1">O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends</a>
<a NAME="0.101.2">For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?</a>
<a NAME="0.101.3">Both truth and beauty on my love depends;</a>
<a NAME="0.101.4">So dost thou too, and therein dignified.</a>
<a NAME="0.101.5">Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say</a>
<a NAME="0.101.6">'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;</a>
<a NAME="0.101.7">Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;</a>
<a NAME="0.101.8">But best is best, if never intermix'd?'</a>
<a NAME="0.101.9">Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?</a>
<a NAME="0.101.10">Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee</a>
<a NAME="0.101.11">To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,</a>
<a NAME="0.101.12">And to be praised of ages yet to be.</a>
<a NAME="0.101.13">  Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how</a>
<a NAME="0.101.14">  To make him seem long hence as he shows now.</a>
