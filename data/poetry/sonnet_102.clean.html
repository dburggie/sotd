<a NAME="0.102.1">My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;</a>
<a NAME="0.102.2">I love not less, though less the show appear:</a>
<a NAME="0.102.3">That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming</a>
<a NAME="0.102.4">The owner's tongue doth publish every where.</a>
<a NAME="0.102.5">Our love was new and then but in the spring</a>
<a NAME="0.102.6">When I was wont to greet it with my lays,</a>
<a NAME="0.102.7">As Philomel in summer's front doth sing</a>
<a NAME="0.102.8">And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:</a>
<a NAME="0.102.9">Not that the summer is less pleasant now</a>
<a NAME="0.102.10">Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,</a>
<a NAME="0.102.11">But that wild music burthens every bough</a>
<a NAME="0.102.12">And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.</a>
<a NAME="0.102.13">  Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,</a>
<a NAME="0.102.14">  Because I would not dull you with my song.</a>
