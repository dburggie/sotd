<a NAME="0.103.1">Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,</a>
<a NAME="0.103.2">That having such a scope to show her pride,</a>
<a NAME="0.103.3">The argument all bare is of more worth</a>
<a NAME="0.103.4">Than when it hath my added praise beside!</a>
<a NAME="0.103.5">O, blame me not, if I no more can write!</a>
<a NAME="0.103.6">Look in your glass, and there appears a face</a>
<a NAME="0.103.7">That over-goes my blunt invention quite,</a>
<a NAME="0.103.8">Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.</a>
<a NAME="0.103.9">Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,</a>
<a NAME="0.103.10">To mar the subject that before was well?</a>
<a NAME="0.103.11">For to no other pass my verses tend</a>
<a NAME="0.103.12">Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;</a>
<a NAME="0.103.13">  And more, much more, than in my verse can sit</a>
<a NAME="0.103.14">  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.</a>
