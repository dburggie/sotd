<a NAME="0.104.1">To me, fair friend, you never can be old,</a>
<a NAME="0.104.2">For as you were when first your eye I eyed,</a>
<a NAME="0.104.3">Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold</a>
<a NAME="0.104.4">Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,</a>
<a NAME="0.104.5">Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd</a>
<a NAME="0.104.6">In process of the seasons have I seen,</a>
<a NAME="0.104.7">Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.104.8">Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.</a>
<a NAME="0.104.9">Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,</a>
<a NAME="0.104.10">Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;</a>
<a NAME="0.104.11">So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,</a>
<a NAME="0.104.12">Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:</a>
<a NAME="0.104.13">  For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;</a>
<a NAME="0.104.14">  Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.</a>
