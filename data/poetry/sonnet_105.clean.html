<a NAME="0.105.1">Let not my love be call'd idolatry,</a>
<a NAME="0.105.2">Nor my beloved as an idol show,</a>
<a NAME="0.105.3">Since all alike my songs and praises be</a>
<a NAME="0.105.4">To one, of one, still such, and ever so.</a>
<a NAME="0.105.5">Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,</a>
<a NAME="0.105.6">Still constant in a wondrous excellence;</a>
<a NAME="0.105.7">Therefore my verse to constancy confined,</a>
<a NAME="0.105.8">One thing expressing, leaves out difference.</a>
<a NAME="0.105.9">'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,</a>
<a NAME="0.105.10">'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;</a>
<a NAME="0.105.11">And in this change is my invention spent,</a>
<a NAME="0.105.12">Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.</a>
<a NAME="0.105.13">  'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,</a>
<a NAME="0.105.14">  Which three till now never kept seat in one.</a>
