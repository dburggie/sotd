<a NAME="0.106.1">When in the chronicle of wasted time</a>
<a NAME="0.106.2">I see descriptions of the fairest wights,</a>
<a NAME="0.106.3">And beauty making beautiful old rhyme</a>
<a NAME="0.106.4">In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,</a>
<a NAME="0.106.5">Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,</a>
<a NAME="0.106.6">Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,</a>
<a NAME="0.106.7">I see their antique pen would have express'd</a>
<a NAME="0.106.8">Even such a beauty as you master now.</a>
<a NAME="0.106.9">So all their praises are but prophecies</a>
<a NAME="0.106.10">Of this our time, all you prefiguring;</a>
<a NAME="0.106.11">And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,</a>
<a NAME="0.106.12">They had not skill enough your worth to sing:</a>
<a NAME="0.106.13">  For we, which now behold these present days,</a>
<a NAME="0.106.14">  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.</a>
