<a NAME="0.107.1">Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul</a>
<a NAME="0.107.2">Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,</a>
<a NAME="0.107.3">Can yet the lease of my true love control,</a>
<a NAME="0.107.4">Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.</a>
<a NAME="0.107.5">The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured</a>
<a NAME="0.107.6">And the sad augurs mock their own presage;</a>
<a NAME="0.107.7">Incertainties now crown themselves assured</a>
<a NAME="0.107.8">And peace proclaims olives of endless age.</a>
<a NAME="0.107.9">Now with the drops of this most balmy time</a>
<a NAME="0.107.10">My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,</a>
<a NAME="0.107.11">Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,</a>
<a NAME="0.107.12">While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:</a>
<a NAME="0.107.13">  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,</a>
<a NAME="0.107.14">  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.</a>
