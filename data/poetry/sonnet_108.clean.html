<a NAME="0.108.1">What's in the brain that ink may character</a>
<a NAME="0.108.2">Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?</a>
<a NAME="0.108.3">What's new to speak, what new to register,</a>
<a NAME="0.108.4">That may express my love or thy dear merit?</a>
<a NAME="0.108.5">Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,</a>
<a NAME="0.108.6">I must, each day say o'er the very same,</a>
<a NAME="0.108.7">Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,</a>
<a NAME="0.108.8">Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.</a>
<a NAME="0.108.9">So that eternal love in love's fresh case</a>
<a NAME="0.108.10">Weighs not the dust and injury of age,</a>
<a NAME="0.108.11">Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,</a>
<a NAME="0.108.12">But makes antiquity for aye his page,</a>
<a NAME="0.108.13">  Finding the first conceit of love there bred</a>
<a NAME="0.108.14">  Where time and outward form would show it dead.</a>
