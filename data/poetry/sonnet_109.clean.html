<a NAME="0.109.1">O, never say that I was false of heart,</a>
<a NAME="0.109.2">Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.</a>
<a NAME="0.109.3">As easy might I from myself depart</a>
<a NAME="0.109.4">As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:</a>
<a NAME="0.109.5">That is my home of love: if I have ranged,</a>
<a NAME="0.109.6">Like him that travels I return again,</a>
<a NAME="0.109.7">Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,</a>
<a NAME="0.109.8">So that myself bring water for my stain.</a>
<a NAME="0.109.9">Never believe, though in my nature reign'd</a>
<a NAME="0.109.10">All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,</a>
<a NAME="0.109.11">That it could so preposterously be stain'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.109.12">To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;</a>
<a NAME="0.109.13">  For nothing this wide universe I call,</a>
<a NAME="0.109.14">  Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.</a>
