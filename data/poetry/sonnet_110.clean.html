<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.110.1">Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there</a>
<a NAME="0.110.2">And made myself a motley to the view,</a>
<a NAME="0.110.3">Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,</a>
<a NAME="0.110.4">Made old offences of affections new;</a>
<a NAME="0.110.5">Most true it is that I have look'd on truth</a>
<a NAME="0.110.6">Askance and strangely: but, by all above,</a>
<a NAME="0.110.7">These blenches gave my heart another youth,</a>
<a NAME="0.110.8">And worse essays proved thee my best of love.</a>
<a NAME="0.110.9">Now all is done, have what shall have no end:</a>
<a NAME="0.110.10">Mine appetite I never more will grind</a>
<a NAME="0.110.11">On newer proof, to try an older friend,</a>
<a NAME="0.110.12">A god in love, to whom I am confined.</a>
<a NAME="0.110.13">  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,</a>
<a NAME="0.110.14">  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.</a>
