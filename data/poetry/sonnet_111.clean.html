<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.111.1">O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,</a>
<a NAME="0.111.2">The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,</a>
<a NAME="0.111.3">That did not better for my life provide</a>
<a NAME="0.111.4">Than public means which public manners breeds.</a>
<a NAME="0.111.5">Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,</a>
<a NAME="0.111.6">And almost thence my nature is subdued</a>
<a NAME="0.111.7">To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:</a>
<a NAME="0.111.8">Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;</a>
<a NAME="0.111.9">Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink</a>
<a NAME="0.111.10">Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection</a>
<a NAME="0.111.11">No bitterness that I will bitter think,</a>
<a NAME="0.111.12">Nor double penance, to correct correction.</a>
<a NAME="0.111.13">  Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye</a>
<a NAME="0.111.14">  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.</a>
