<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.112.1">Your love and pity doth the impression fill</a>
<a NAME="0.112.2">Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;</a>
<a NAME="0.112.3">For what care I who calls me well or ill,</a>
<a NAME="0.112.4">So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?</a>
<a NAME="0.112.5">You are my all the world, and I must strive</a>
<a NAME="0.112.6">To know my shames and praises from your tongue:</a>
<a NAME="0.112.7">None else to me, nor I to none alive,</a>
<a NAME="0.112.8">That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.</a>
<a NAME="0.112.9">In so profound abysm I throw all care</a>
<a NAME="0.112.10">Of others' voices, that my adder's sense</a>
<a NAME="0.112.11">To critic and to flatterer stopped are.</a>
<a NAME="0.112.12">Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:</a>
<a NAME="0.112.13">  You are so strongly in my purpose bred</a>
<a NAME="0.112.14">  That all the world besides methinks are dead.</a>
