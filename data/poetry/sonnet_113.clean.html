<a NAME="0.113.1">Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;</a>
<a NAME="0.113.2">And that which governs me to go about</a>
<a NAME="0.113.3">Doth part his function and is partly blind,</a>
<a NAME="0.113.4">Seems seeing, but effectually is out;</a>
<a NAME="0.113.5">For it no form delivers to the heart</a>
<a NAME="0.113.6">Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:</a>
<a NAME="0.113.7">Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,</a>
<a NAME="0.113.8">Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:</a>
<a NAME="0.113.9">For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,</a>
<a NAME="0.113.10">The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,</a>
<a NAME="0.113.11">The mountain or the sea, the day or night,</a>
<a NAME="0.113.12">The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:</a>
<a NAME="0.113.13">  Incapable of more, replete with you,</a>
<a NAME="0.113.14">  My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.</a>
