<a NAME="0.114.1">Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,</a>
<a NAME="0.114.2">Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?</a>
<a NAME="0.114.3">Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,</a>
<a NAME="0.114.4">And that your love taught it this alchemy,</a>
<a NAME="0.114.5">To make of monsters and things indigest</a>
<a NAME="0.114.6">Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,</a>
<a NAME="0.114.7">Creating every bad a perfect best,</a>
<a NAME="0.114.8">As fast as objects to his beams assemble?</a>
<a NAME="0.114.9">O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,</a>
<a NAME="0.114.10">And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:</a>
<a NAME="0.114.11">Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,</a>
<a NAME="0.114.12">And to his palate doth prepare the cup:</a>
<a NAME="0.114.13">  If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin</a>
<a NAME="0.114.14">  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.</a>
