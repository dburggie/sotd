<a NAME="0.115.1">Those lines that I before have writ do lie,</a>
<a NAME="0.115.2">Even those that said I could not love you dearer:</a>
<a NAME="0.115.3">Yet then my judgment knew no reason why</a>
<a NAME="0.115.4">My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.</a>
<a NAME="0.115.5">But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents</a>
<a NAME="0.115.6">Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,</a>
<a NAME="0.115.7">Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,</a>
<a NAME="0.115.8">Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;</a>
<a NAME="0.115.9">Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,</a>
<a NAME="0.115.10">Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'</a>
<a NAME="0.115.11">When I was certain o'er incertainty,</a>
<a NAME="0.115.12">Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?</a>
<a NAME="0.115.13">  Love is a babe; then might I not say so,</a>
<a NAME="0.115.14">  To give full growth to that which still doth grow?</a>
