<a NAME="0.116.1">Let me not to the marriage of true minds</a>
<a NAME="0.116.2">Admit impediments. Love is not love</a>
<a NAME="0.116.3">Which alters when it alteration finds,</a>
<a NAME="0.116.4">Or bends with the remover to remove:</a>
<a NAME="0.116.5">O no! it is an ever-fixed mark</a>
<a NAME="0.116.6">That looks on tempests and is never shaken;</a>
<a NAME="0.116.7">It is the star to every wandering bark,</a>
<a NAME="0.116.8">Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</a>
<a NAME="0.116.9">Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks</a>
<a NAME="0.116.10">Within his bending sickle's compass come:</a>
<a NAME="0.116.11">Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,</a>
<a NAME="0.116.12">But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</a>
<a NAME="0.116.13">  If this be error and upon me proved,</a>
<a NAME="0.116.14">  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</a>
