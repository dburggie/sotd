<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.117.1">Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all</a>
<a NAME="0.117.2">Wherein I should your great deserts repay,</a>
<a NAME="0.117.3">Forgot upon your dearest love to call,</a>
<a NAME="0.117.4">Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;</a>
<a NAME="0.117.5">That I have frequent been with unknown minds</a>
<a NAME="0.117.6">And given to time your own dear-purchased right</a>
<a NAME="0.117.7">That I have hoisted sail to all the winds</a>
<a NAME="0.117.8">Which should transport me farthest from your sight.</a>
<a NAME="0.117.9">Book both my wilfulness and errors down</a>
<a NAME="0.117.10">And on just proof surmise accumulate;</a>
<a NAME="0.117.11">Bring me within the level of your frown,</a>
<a NAME="0.117.12">But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;</a>
<a NAME="0.117.13">  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove</a>
<a NAME="0.117.14">  The constancy and virtue of your love.</a>
