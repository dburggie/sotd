<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.118.1">Like as, to make our appetites more keen,</a>
<a NAME="0.118.2">With eager compounds we our palate urge,</a>
<a NAME="0.118.3">As, to prevent our maladies unseen,</a>
<a NAME="0.118.4">We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,</a>
<a NAME="0.118.5">Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,</a>
<a NAME="0.118.6">To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding</a>
<a NAME="0.118.7">And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness</a>
<a NAME="0.118.8">To be diseased ere that there was true needing.</a>
<a NAME="0.118.9">Thus policy in love, to anticipate</a>
<a NAME="0.118.10">The ills that were not, grew to faults assured</a>
<a NAME="0.118.11">And brought to medicine a healthful state</a>
<a NAME="0.118.12">Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:</a>
<a NAME="0.118.13">  But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,</a>
<a NAME="0.118.14">  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.</a>
