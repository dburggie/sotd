<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.119.1">What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,</a>
<a NAME="0.119.2">Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,</a>
<a NAME="0.119.3">Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,</a>
<a NAME="0.119.4">Still losing when I saw myself to win!</a>
<a NAME="0.119.5">What wretched errors hath my heart committed,</a>
<a NAME="0.119.6">Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!</a>
<a NAME="0.119.7">How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted</a>
<a NAME="0.119.8">In the distraction of this madding fever!</a>
<a NAME="0.119.9">O benefit of ill! now I find true</a>
<a NAME="0.119.10">That better is by evil still made better;</a>
<a NAME="0.119.11">And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,</a>
<a NAME="0.119.12">Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.</a>
<a NAME="0.119.13">  So I return rebuked to my content</a>
<a NAME="0.119.14">  And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.</a>
