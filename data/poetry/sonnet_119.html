<h1>Sonnet CXIX</h1>

<blockquote>What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,<br>
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,<br>
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,<br>
Still losing when I saw myself to win!<br>
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,<br>
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!<br>
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted<br>
In the distraction of this madding fever!<br>
O benefit of ill! now I find true<br>
That better is by evil still made better;<br>
And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,<br>
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.<br>
  So I return rebuked to my content<br>
  And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.<br>
