<a NAME="0.120.1">That you were once unkind befriends me now,</a>
<a NAME="0.120.2">And for that sorrow which I then did feel</a>
<a NAME="0.120.3">Needs must I under my transgression bow,</a>
<a NAME="0.120.4">Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.</a>
<a NAME="0.120.5">For if you were by my unkindness shaken</a>
<a NAME="0.120.6">As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,</a>
<a NAME="0.120.7">And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken</a>
<a NAME="0.120.8">To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.</a>
<a NAME="0.120.9">O, that our night of woe might have remember'd</a>
<a NAME="0.120.10">My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,</a>
<a NAME="0.120.11">And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd</a>
<a NAME="0.120.12">The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!</a>
<a NAME="0.120.13">  But that your trespass now becomes a fee;</a>
<a NAME="0.120.14">  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.</a>
