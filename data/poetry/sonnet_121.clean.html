<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.121.1">'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,</a>
<a NAME="0.121.2">When not to be receives reproach of being,</a>
<a NAME="0.121.3">And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd</a>
<a NAME="0.121.4">Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:</a>
<a NAME="0.121.5">For why should others false adulterate eyes</a>
<a NAME="0.121.6">Give salutation to my sportive blood?</a>
<a NAME="0.121.7">Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,</a>
<a NAME="0.121.8">Which in their wills count bad what I think good?</a>
<a NAME="0.121.9">No, I am that I am, and they that level</a>
<a NAME="0.121.10">At my abuses reckon up their own:</a>
<a NAME="0.121.11">I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;</a>
<a NAME="0.121.12">By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;</a>
<a NAME="0.121.13">  Unless this general evil they maintain,</a>
<a NAME="0.121.14">  All men are bad, and in their badness reign.</a>
