<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.122.1">Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain</a>
<a NAME="0.122.2">Full character'd with lasting memory,</a>
<a NAME="0.122.3">Which shall above that idle rank remain</a>
<a NAME="0.122.4">Beyond all date, even to eternity;</a>
<a NAME="0.122.5">Or at the least, so long as brain and heart</a>
<a NAME="0.122.6">Have faculty by nature to subsist;</a>
<a NAME="0.122.7">Till each to razed oblivion yield his part</a>
<a NAME="0.122.8">Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.</a>
<a NAME="0.122.9">That poor retention could not so much hold,</a>
<a NAME="0.122.10">Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;</a>
<a NAME="0.122.11">Therefore to give them from me was I bold,</a>
<a NAME="0.122.12">To trust those tables that receive thee more:</a>
<a NAME="0.122.13">  To keep an adjunct to remember thee</a>
<a NAME="0.122.14">  Were to import forgetfulness in me.</a>
