<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.123.1">No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:</a>
<a NAME="0.123.2">Thy pyramids built up with newer might</a>
<a NAME="0.123.3">To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;</a>
<a NAME="0.123.4">They are but dressings of a former sight.</a>
<a NAME="0.123.5">Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire</a>
<a NAME="0.123.6">What thou dost foist upon us that is old,</a>
<a NAME="0.123.7">And rather make them born to our desire</a>
<a NAME="0.123.8">Than think that we before have heard them told.</a>
<a NAME="0.123.9">Thy registers and thee I both defy,</a>
<a NAME="0.123.10">Not wondering at the present nor the past,</a>
<a NAME="0.123.11">For thy records and what we see doth lie,</a>
<a NAME="0.123.12">Made more or less by thy continual haste.</a>
<a NAME="0.123.13">  This I do vow and this shall ever be;</a>
<a NAME="0.123.14">  I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.</a>
