<a NAME="0.124.1">If my dear love were but the child of state,</a>
<a NAME="0.124.2">It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'</a>
<a NAME="0.124.3">As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,</a>
<a NAME="0.124.4">Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.</a>
<a NAME="0.124.5">No, it was builded far from accident;</a>
<a NAME="0.124.6">It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls</a>
<a NAME="0.124.7">Under the blow of thralled discontent,</a>
<a NAME="0.124.8">Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:</a>
<a NAME="0.124.9">It fears not policy, that heretic,</a>
<a NAME="0.124.10">Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,</a>
<a NAME="0.124.11">But all alone stands hugely politic,</a>
<a NAME="0.124.12">That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.</a>
<a NAME="0.124.13">  To this I witness call the fools of time,</a>
<a NAME="0.124.14">  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.</a>
