<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.125.1">Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,</a>
<a NAME="0.125.2">With my extern the outward honouring,</a>
<a NAME="0.125.3">Or laid great bases for eternity,</a>
<a NAME="0.125.4">Which prove more short than waste or ruining?</a>
<a NAME="0.125.5">Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour</a>
<a NAME="0.125.6">Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,</a>
<a NAME="0.125.7">For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,</a>
<a NAME="0.125.8">Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?</a>
<a NAME="0.125.9">No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,</a>
<a NAME="0.125.10">And take thou my oblation, poor but free,</a>
<a NAME="0.125.11">Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,</a>
<a NAME="0.125.12">But mutual render, only me for thee.</a>
<a NAME="0.125.13">  Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul</a>
<a NAME="0.125.14">  When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.</a>
