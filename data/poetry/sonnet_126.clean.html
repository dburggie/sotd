<a NAME="0.126.1">O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power</a>
<a NAME="0.126.2">Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;</a>
<a NAME="0.126.3">Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st</a>
<a NAME="0.126.4">Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;</a>
<a NAME="0.126.5">If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,</a>
<a NAME="0.126.6">As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,</a>
<a NAME="0.126.7">She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill</a>
<a NAME="0.126.8">May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.</a>
<a NAME="0.126.9">Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!</a>
<a NAME="0.126.10">She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:</a>
<a NAME="0.126.11">  Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,</a>
<a NAME="0.126.12">  And her quietus is to render thee.</a>
