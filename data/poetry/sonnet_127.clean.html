<a NAME="0.127.1">In the old age black was not counted fair,</a>
<a NAME="0.127.2">Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;</a>
<a NAME="0.127.3">But now is black beauty's successive heir,</a>
<a NAME="0.127.4">And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:</a>
<a NAME="0.127.5">For since each hand hath put on nature's power,</a>
<a NAME="0.127.6">Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,</a>
<a NAME="0.127.7">Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,</a>
<a NAME="0.127.8">But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.</a>
<a NAME="0.127.9">Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,</a>
<a NAME="0.127.10">Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem</a>
<a NAME="0.127.11">At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,</a>
<a NAME="0.127.12">Slandering creation with a false esteem:</a>
<a NAME="0.127.13">  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,</a>
<a NAME="0.127.14">  That every tongue says beauty should look so.</a>
