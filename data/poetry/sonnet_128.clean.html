<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.128.1">How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,</a>
<a NAME="0.128.2">Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds</a>
<a NAME="0.128.3">With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st</a>
<a NAME="0.128.4">The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,</a>
<a NAME="0.128.5">Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap</a>
<a NAME="0.128.6">To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,</a>
<a NAME="0.128.7">Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,</a>
<a NAME="0.128.8">At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!</a>
<a NAME="0.128.9">To be so tickled, they would change their state</a>
<a NAME="0.128.10">And situation with those dancing chips,</a>
<a NAME="0.128.11">O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,</a>
<a NAME="0.128.12">Making dead wood more blest than living lips.</a>
<a NAME="0.128.13">  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,</a>
<a NAME="0.128.14">  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.</a>
