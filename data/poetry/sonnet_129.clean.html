<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.129.1">The expense of spirit in a waste of shame</a>
<a NAME="0.129.2">Is lust in action; and till action, lust</a>
<a NAME="0.129.3">Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,</a>
<a NAME="0.129.4">Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,</a>
<a NAME="0.129.5">Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,</a>
<a NAME="0.129.6">Past reason hunted, and no sooner had</a>
<a NAME="0.129.7">Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait</a>
<a NAME="0.129.8">On purpose laid to make the taker mad;</a>
<a NAME="0.129.9">Mad in pursuit and in possession so;</a>
<a NAME="0.129.10">Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;</a>
<a NAME="0.129.11">A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;</a>
<a NAME="0.129.12">Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.</a>
<a NAME="0.129.13">  All this the world well knows; yet none knows well</a>
<a NAME="0.129.14">  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.</a>
