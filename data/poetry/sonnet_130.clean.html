<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.130.1">My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;</a>
<a NAME="0.130.2">Coral is far more red than her lips' red;</a>
<a NAME="0.130.3">If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;</a>
<a NAME="0.130.4">If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.</a>
<a NAME="0.130.5">I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,</a>
<a NAME="0.130.6">But no such roses see I in her cheeks;</a>
<a NAME="0.130.7">And in some perfumes is there more delight</a>
<a NAME="0.130.8">Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.</a>
<a NAME="0.130.9">I love to hear her speak, yet well I know</a>
<a NAME="0.130.10">That music hath a far more pleasing sound;</a>
<a NAME="0.130.11">I grant I never saw a goddess go;</a>
<a NAME="0.130.12">My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:</a>
<a NAME="0.130.13">  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare</a>
<a NAME="0.130.14">  As any she belied with false compare.</a>
