<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.131.1">Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,</a>
<a NAME="0.131.2">As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;</a>
<a NAME="0.131.3">For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart</a>
<a NAME="0.131.4">Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.</a>
<a NAME="0.131.5">Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold</a>
<a NAME="0.131.6">Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:</a>
<a NAME="0.131.7">To say they err I dare not be so bold,</a>
<a NAME="0.131.8">Although I swear it to myself alone.</a>
<a NAME="0.131.9">And, to be sure that is not false I swear,</a>
<a NAME="0.131.10">A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,</a>
<a NAME="0.131.11">One on another's neck, do witness bear</a>
<a NAME="0.131.12">Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.</a>
<a NAME="0.131.13">  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,</a>
<a NAME="0.131.14">  And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.</a>
