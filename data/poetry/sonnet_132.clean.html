<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.132.1">Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,</a>
<a NAME="0.132.2">Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,</a>
<a NAME="0.132.3">Have put on black and loving mourners be,</a>
<a NAME="0.132.4">Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.</a>
<a NAME="0.132.5">And truly not the morning sun of heaven</a>
<a NAME="0.132.6">Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,</a>
<a NAME="0.132.7">Nor that full star that ushers in the even</a>
<a NAME="0.132.8">Doth half that glory to the sober west,</a>
<a NAME="0.132.9">As those two mourning eyes become thy face:</a>
<a NAME="0.132.10">O, let it then as well beseem thy heart</a>
<a NAME="0.132.11">To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,</a>
<a NAME="0.132.12">And suit thy pity like in every part.</a>
<a NAME="0.132.13">  Then will I swear beauty herself is black</a>
<a NAME="0.132.14">  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.</a>
