<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.133.1">Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan</a>
<a NAME="0.133.2">For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!</a>
<a NAME="0.133.3">Is't not enough to torture me alone,</a>
<a NAME="0.133.4">But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?</a>
<a NAME="0.133.5">Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,</a>
<a NAME="0.133.6">And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:</a>
<a NAME="0.133.7">Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;</a>
<a NAME="0.133.8">A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.</a>
<a NAME="0.133.9">Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,</a>
<a NAME="0.133.10">But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;</a>
<a NAME="0.133.11">Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;</a>
<a NAME="0.133.12">Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:</a>
<a NAME="0.133.13">  And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.133.14">  Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.</a>
