<a NAME="0.134.1">So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,</a>
<a NAME="0.134.2">And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,</a>
<a NAME="0.134.3">Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine</a>
<a NAME="0.134.4">Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:</a>
<a NAME="0.134.5">But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,</a>
<a NAME="0.134.6">For thou art covetous and he is kind;</a>
<a NAME="0.134.7">He learn'd but surety-like to write for me</a>
<a NAME="0.134.8">Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.</a>
<a NAME="0.134.9">The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,</a>
<a NAME="0.134.10">Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,</a>
<a NAME="0.134.11">And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;</a>
<a NAME="0.134.12">So him I lose through my unkind abuse.</a>
<a NAME="0.134.13">  Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:</a>
<a NAME="0.134.14">  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.</a>
