<a NAME="0.135.1">Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'</a>
<a NAME="0.135.2">And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;</a>
<a NAME="0.135.3">More than enough am I that vex thee still,</a>
<a NAME="0.135.4">To thy sweet will making addition thus.</a>
<a NAME="0.135.5">Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,</a>
<a NAME="0.135.6">Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?</a>
<a NAME="0.135.7">Shall will in others seem right gracious,</a>
<a NAME="0.135.8">And in my will no fair acceptance shine?</a>
<a NAME="0.135.9">The sea all water, yet receives rain still</a>
<a NAME="0.135.10">And in abundance addeth to his store;</a>
<a NAME="0.135.11">So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'</a>
<a NAME="0.135.12">One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.</a>
<a NAME="0.135.13">  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;</a>
<a NAME="0.135.14">  Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'</a>
