<a NAME="0.136.1">If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,</a>
<a NAME="0.136.2">Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'</a>
<a NAME="0.136.3">And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;</a>
<a NAME="0.136.4">Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.</a>
<a NAME="0.136.5">'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,</a>
<a NAME="0.136.6">Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.</a>
<a NAME="0.136.7">In things of great receipt with ease we prove</a>
<a NAME="0.136.8">Among a number one is reckon'd none:</a>
<a NAME="0.136.9">Then in the number let me pass untold,</a>
<a NAME="0.136.10">Though in thy stores' account I one must be;</a>
<a NAME="0.136.11">For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold</a>
<a NAME="0.136.12">That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:</a>
<a NAME="0.136.13">  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,</a>
<a NAME="0.136.14">  And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'</a>
