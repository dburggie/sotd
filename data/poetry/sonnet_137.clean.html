<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.137.1">Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,</a>
<a NAME="0.137.2">That they behold, and see not what they see?</a>
<a NAME="0.137.3">They know what beauty is, see where it lies,</a>
<a NAME="0.137.4">Yet what the best is take the worst to be.</a>
<a NAME="0.137.5">If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks</a>
<a NAME="0.137.6">Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,</a>
<a NAME="0.137.7">Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,</a>
<a NAME="0.137.8">Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?</a>
<a NAME="0.137.9">Why should my heart think that a several plot</a>
<a NAME="0.137.10">Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?</a>
<a NAME="0.137.11">Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,</a>
<a NAME="0.137.12">To put fair truth upon so foul a face?</a>
<a NAME="0.137.13">  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,</a>
<a NAME="0.137.14">  And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.</a>
