<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.138.1">When my love swears that she is made of truth</a>
<a NAME="0.138.2">I do believe her, though I know she lies,</a>
<a NAME="0.138.3">That she might think me some untutor'd youth,</a>
<a NAME="0.138.4">Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.</a>
<a NAME="0.138.5">Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</a>
<a NAME="0.138.6">Although she knows my days are past the best,</a>
<a NAME="0.138.7">Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:</a>
<a NAME="0.138.8">On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.</a>
<a NAME="0.138.9">But wherefore says she not she is unjust?</a>
<a NAME="0.138.10">And wherefore say not I that I am old?</a>
<a NAME="0.138.11">O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,</a>
<a NAME="0.138.12">And age in love loves not to have years told:</a>
<a NAME="0.138.13">  Therefore I lie with her and she with me,</a>
<a NAME="0.138.14">  And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.</a>
