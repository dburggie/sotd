<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.139.1">O, call not me to justify the wrong</a>
<a NAME="0.139.2">That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;</a>
<a NAME="0.139.3">Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;</a>
<a NAME="0.139.4">Use power with power and slay me not by art.</a>
<a NAME="0.139.5">Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,</a>
<a NAME="0.139.6">Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:</a>
<a NAME="0.139.7">What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might</a>
<a NAME="0.139.8">Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?</a>
<a NAME="0.139.9">Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows</a>
<a NAME="0.139.10">Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,</a>
<a NAME="0.139.11">And therefore from my face she turns my foes,</a>
<a NAME="0.139.12">That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:</a>
<a NAME="0.139.13">  Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,</a>
<a NAME="0.139.14">  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.</a>
