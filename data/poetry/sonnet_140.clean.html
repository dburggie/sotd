<a NAME="0.140.1">Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press</a>
<a NAME="0.140.2">My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;</a>
<a NAME="0.140.3">Lest sorrow lend me words and words express</a>
<a NAME="0.140.4">The manner of my pity-wanting pain.</a>
<a NAME="0.140.5">If I might teach thee wit, better it were,</a>
<a NAME="0.140.6">Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;</a>
<a NAME="0.140.7">As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,</a>
<a NAME="0.140.8">No news but health from their physicians know;</a>
<a NAME="0.140.9">For if I should despair, I should grow mad,</a>
<a NAME="0.140.10">And in my madness might speak ill of thee:</a>
<a NAME="0.140.11">Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,</a>
<a NAME="0.140.12">Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,</a>
<a NAME="0.140.13">  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,</a>
<a NAME="0.140.14">  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.</a>
