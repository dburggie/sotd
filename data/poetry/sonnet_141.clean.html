<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.141.1">In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,</a>
<a NAME="0.141.2">For they in thee a thousand errors note;</a>
<a NAME="0.141.3">But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,</a>
<a NAME="0.141.4">Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;</a>
<a NAME="0.141.5">Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,</a>
<a NAME="0.141.6">Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,</a>
<a NAME="0.141.7">Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited</a>
<a NAME="0.141.8">To any sensual feast with thee alone:</a>
<a NAME="0.141.9">But my five wits nor my five senses can</a>
<a NAME="0.141.10">Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.141.11">Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,</a>
<a NAME="0.141.12">Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:</a>
<a NAME="0.141.13">  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,</a>
<a NAME="0.141.14">  That she that makes me sin awards me pain.</a>
