<a NAME="0.142.1">Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,</a>
<a NAME="0.142.2">Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:</a>
<a NAME="0.142.3">O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,</a>
<a NAME="0.142.4">And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;</a>
<a NAME="0.142.5">Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,</a>
<a NAME="0.142.6">That have profaned their scarlet ornaments</a>
<a NAME="0.142.7">And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,</a>
<a NAME="0.142.8">Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.</a>
<a NAME="0.142.9">Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those</a>
<a NAME="0.142.10">Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:</a>
<a NAME="0.142.11">Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows</a>
<a NAME="0.142.12">Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.</a>
<a NAME="0.142.13">  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,</a>
<a NAME="0.142.14">  By self-example mayst thou be denied!</a>
