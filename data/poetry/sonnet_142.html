<h1>Sonnet CXLII</h1>

<blockquote>Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,<br>
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:<br>
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,<br>
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;<br>
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,<br>
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments<br>
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,<br>
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.<br>
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those<br>
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:<br>
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows<br>
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.<br>
  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,<br>
  By self-example mayst thou be denied!<br>
