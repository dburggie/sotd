<a NAME="0.143.1">Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch</a>
<a NAME="0.143.2">One of her feather'd creatures broke away,</a>
<a NAME="0.143.3">Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch</a>
<a NAME="0.143.4">In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,</a>
<a NAME="0.143.5">Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,</a>
<a NAME="0.143.6">Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent</a>
<a NAME="0.143.7">To follow that which flies before her face,</a>
<a NAME="0.143.8">Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;</a>
<a NAME="0.143.9">So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.143.10">Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;</a>
<a NAME="0.143.11">But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,</a>
<a NAME="0.143.12">And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:</a>
<a NAME="0.143.13">  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'</a>
<a NAME="0.143.14">  If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.</a>
