<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.144.1">Two loves I have of comfort and despair,</a>
<a NAME="0.144.2">Which like two spirits do suggest me still:</a>
<a NAME="0.144.3">The better angel is a man right fair,</a>
<a NAME="0.144.4">The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.</a>
<a NAME="0.144.5">To win me soon to hell, my female evil</a>
<a NAME="0.144.6">Tempteth my better angel from my side,</a>
<a NAME="0.144.7">And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,</a>
<a NAME="0.144.8">Wooing his purity with her foul pride.</a>
<a NAME="0.144.9">And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend</a>
<a NAME="0.144.10">Suspect I may, but not directly tell;</a>
<a NAME="0.144.11">But being both from me, both to each friend,</a>
<a NAME="0.144.12">I guess one angel in another's hell:</a>
<a NAME="0.144.13">  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,</a>
<a NAME="0.144.14">  Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</a>
