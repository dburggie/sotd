<a NAME="0.145.1">Those lips that Love's own hand did make</a>
<a NAME="0.145.2">Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'</a>
<a NAME="0.145.3">To me that languish'd for her sake;</a>
<a NAME="0.145.4">But when she saw my woeful state,</a>
<a NAME="0.145.5">Straight in her heart did mercy come,</a>
<a NAME="0.145.6">Chiding that tongue that ever sweet</a>
<a NAME="0.145.7">Was used in giving gentle doom,</a>
<a NAME="0.145.8">And taught it thus anew to greet:</a>
<a NAME="0.145.9">'I hate' she alter'd with an end,</a>
<a NAME="0.145.10">That follow'd it as gentle day</a>
<a NAME="0.145.11">Doth follow night, who like a fiend</a>
<a NAME="0.145.12">From heaven to hell is flown away;</a>
<a NAME="0.145.13">  'I hate' from hate away she threw,</a>
<a NAME="0.145.14">  And saved my life, saying 'not you.'</a>
