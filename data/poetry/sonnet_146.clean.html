<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.146.1">Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,</a>
<a NAME="0.146.2">[         ] these rebel powers that thee array;</a>
<a NAME="0.146.3">Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,</a>
<a NAME="0.146.4">Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?</a>
<a NAME="0.146.5">Why so large cost, having so short a lease,</a>
<a NAME="0.146.6">Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?</a>
<a NAME="0.146.7">Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,</a>
<a NAME="0.146.8">Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?</a>
<a NAME="0.146.9">Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,</a>
<a NAME="0.146.10">And let that pine to aggravate thy store;</a>
<a NAME="0.146.11">Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;</a>
<a NAME="0.146.12">Within be fed, without be rich no more:</a>
<a NAME="0.146.13">  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,</a>
<a NAME="0.146.14">  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.</a>
