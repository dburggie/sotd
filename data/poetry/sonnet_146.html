<h1>Sonnet CXLVI</h1>

<blockquote>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,<br>
[         ] these rebel powers that thee array;<br>
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,<br>
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?<br>
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,<br>
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?<br>
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,<br>
Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?<br>
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,<br>
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;<br>
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;<br>
Within be fed, without be rich no more:<br>
  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,<br>
  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.<br>
</blockquote>
