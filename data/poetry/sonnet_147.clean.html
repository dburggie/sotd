<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.147.1">My love is as a fever, longing still</a>
<a NAME="0.147.2">For that which longer nurseth the disease,</a>
<a NAME="0.147.3">Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,</a>
<a NAME="0.147.4">The uncertain sickly appetite to please.</a>
<a NAME="0.147.5">My reason, the physician to my love,</a>
<a NAME="0.147.6">Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,</a>
<a NAME="0.147.7">Hath left me, and I desperate now approve</a>
<a NAME="0.147.8">Desire is death, which physic did except.</a>
<a NAME="0.147.9">Past cure I am, now reason is past care,</a>
<a NAME="0.147.10">And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;</a>
<a NAME="0.147.11">My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,</a>
<a NAME="0.147.12">At random from the truth vainly express'd;</a>
<a NAME="0.147.13">  For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,</a>
<a NAME="0.147.14">  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.</a>
