<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.148.1">O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,</a>
<a NAME="0.148.2">Which have no correspondence with true sight!</a>
<a NAME="0.148.3">Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,</a>
<a NAME="0.148.4">That censures falsely what they see aright?</a>
<a NAME="0.148.5">If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,</a>
<a NAME="0.148.6">What means the world to say it is not so?</a>
<a NAME="0.148.7">If it be not, then love doth well denote</a>
<a NAME="0.148.8">Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'</a>
<a NAME="0.148.9">How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,</a>
<a NAME="0.148.10">That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?</a>
<a NAME="0.148.11">No marvel then, though I mistake my view;</a>
<a NAME="0.148.12">The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.</a>
<a NAME="0.148.13">  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,</a>
<a NAME="0.148.14">  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.</a>
