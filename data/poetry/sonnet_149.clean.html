<a NAME="0.149.1">Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,</a>
<a NAME="0.149.2">When I against myself with thee partake?</a>
<a NAME="0.149.3">Do I not think on thee, when I forgot</a>
<a NAME="0.149.4">Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?</a>
<a NAME="0.149.5">Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?</a>
<a NAME="0.149.6">On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?</a>
<a NAME="0.149.7">Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend</a>
<a NAME="0.149.8">Revenge upon myself with present moan?</a>
<a NAME="0.149.9">What merit do I in myself respect,</a>
<a NAME="0.149.10">That is so proud thy service to despise,</a>
<a NAME="0.149.11">When all my best doth worship thy defect,</a>
<a NAME="0.149.12">Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?</a>
<a NAME="0.149.13">  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;</a>
<a NAME="0.149.14">  Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.</a>
