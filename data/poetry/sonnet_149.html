<h1>Sonnet CXLIX</h1>

<blockquote>Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,<br>
When I against myself with thee partake?<br>
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot<br>
Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?<br>
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?<br>
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?<br>
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend<br>
Revenge upon myself with present moan?<br>
What merit do I in myself respect,<br>
That is so proud thy service to despise,<br>
When all my best doth worship thy defect,<br>
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?<br>
  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;<br>
  Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.<br>
</blockquote>
