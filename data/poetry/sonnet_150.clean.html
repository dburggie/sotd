<a NAME="0.150.1">O, from what power hast thou this powerful might</a>
<a NAME="0.150.2">With insufficiency my heart to sway?</a>
<a NAME="0.150.3">To make me give the lie to my true sight,</a>
<a NAME="0.150.4">And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?</a>
<a NAME="0.150.5">Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,</a>
<a NAME="0.150.6">That in the very refuse of thy deeds</a>
<a NAME="0.150.7">There is such strength and warrantize of skill</a>
<a NAME="0.150.8">That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?</a>
<a NAME="0.150.9">Who taught thee how to make me love thee more</a>
<a NAME="0.150.10">The more I hear and see just cause of hate?</a>
<a NAME="0.150.11">O, though I love what others do abhor,</a>
<a NAME="0.150.12">With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:</a>
<a NAME="0.150.13">  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,</a>
<a NAME="0.150.14">  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.</a>
