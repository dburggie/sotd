<a NAME="0.151.1">Love is too young to know what conscience is;</a>
<a NAME="0.151.2">Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?</a>
<a NAME="0.151.3">Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,</a>
<a NAME="0.151.4">Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:</a>
<a NAME="0.151.5">For, thou betraying me, I do betray</a>
<a NAME="0.151.6">My nobler part to my gross body's treason;</a>
<a NAME="0.151.7">My soul doth tell my body that he may</a>
<a NAME="0.151.8">Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;</a>
<a NAME="0.151.9">But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee</a>
<a NAME="0.151.10">As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,</a>
<a NAME="0.151.11">He is contented thy poor drudge to be,</a>
<a NAME="0.151.12">To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.</a>
<a NAME="0.151.13">  No want of conscience hold it that I call</a>
<a NAME="0.151.14">  Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.</a>
