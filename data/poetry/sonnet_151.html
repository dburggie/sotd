<h1>Sonnet CLI</h1>

<blockquote>Love is too young to know what conscience is;<br>
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?<br>
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,<br>
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:<br>
For, thou betraying me, I do betray<br>
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;<br>
My soul doth tell my body that he may<br>
Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;<br>
But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee<br>
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,<br>
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,<br>
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.<br>
  No want of conscience hold it that I call<br>
  Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.<br>
