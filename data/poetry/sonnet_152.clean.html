<a NAME="0.152.1">In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.2">But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.3">In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.4">In vowing new hate after new love bearing.</a>
<a NAME="0.152.5">But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.6">When I break twenty? I am perjured most;</a>
<a NAME="0.152.7">For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee</a>
<a NAME="0.152.8">And all my honest faith in thee is lost,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.9">For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.10">Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.11">And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.12">Or made them swear against the thing they see;</a>
<a NAME="0.152.13">  For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,</a>
<a NAME="0.152.14">  To swear against the truth so foul a lie!</a>
