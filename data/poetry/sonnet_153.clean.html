<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.153.1">Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:</a>
<a NAME="0.153.2">A maid of Dian's this advantage found,</a>
<a NAME="0.153.3">And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep</a>
<a NAME="0.153.4">In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;</a>
<a NAME="0.153.5">Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love</a>
<a NAME="0.153.6">A dateless lively heat, still to endure,</a>
<a NAME="0.153.7">And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove</a>
<a NAME="0.153.8">Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.</a>
<a NAME="0.153.9">But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,</a>
<a NAME="0.153.10">The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;</a>
<a NAME="0.153.11">I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,</a>
<a NAME="0.153.12">And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,</a>
<a NAME="0.153.13">  But found no cure: the bath for my help lies</a>
<a NAME="0.153.14">  Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.</a>
