<blockquote>
<a NAME="0.154.1">The little Love-god lying once asleep</a>
<a NAME="0.154.2">Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,</a>
<a NAME="0.154.3">Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep</a>
<a NAME="0.154.4">Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand</a>
<a NAME="0.154.5">The fairest votary took up that fire</a>
<a NAME="0.154.6">Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;</a>
<a NAME="0.154.7">And so the general of hot desire</a>
<a NAME="0.154.8">Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.</a>
<a NAME="0.154.9">This brand she quenched in a cool well by,</a>
<a NAME="0.154.10">Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,</a>
<a NAME="0.154.11">Growing a bath and healthful remedy</a>
<a NAME="0.154.12">For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,</a>
<a NAME="0.154.13">  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,</a>
<a NAME="0.154.14">  Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.</a>
