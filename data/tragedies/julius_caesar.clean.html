<a NAME=1.2.46>Conceptions only proper to myself,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.47>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</a>

<a NAME=1.2.49>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</a>
<a NAME=1.2.50>Nor construe any further my neglect,</a>

<a NAME=1.2.56>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech29><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.57>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</a>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.59>'Tis just:</a>
<a NAME=1.2.60>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</a>

<a NAME=1.2.62>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.63>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.64>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.65>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</a>
<a NAME=1.2.66>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.67>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech31><b>BRUTUS</b></a>

<a NAME=1.2.70>For that which is not in me?</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech32><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.71>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</a>
<a NAME=1.2.72>And since you know you cannot see yourself</a>
<a NAME=1.2.73>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.74>Will modestly discover to yourself</a>
<a NAME=1.2.75>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</a>
<a NAME=1.2.76>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</a>
<a NAME=1.2.77>Were I a common laugher, or did use</a>
<a NAME=1.2.78>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</a>
<a NAME=1.2.79>To every new protester; if you know</a>
<a NAME=1.2.80>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</a>
<a NAME=1.2.81>And after scandal them, or if you know</a>
<a NAME=1.2.82>That I profess myself in banqueting</a>
<a NAME=1.2.83>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</a>
</blockquote>

<a NAME=1.2.85>Choose Caesar for their king.</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech34><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.86>Ay, do you fear it?</a>
<a NAME=1.2.87>Then must I think you would not have it so.</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech35><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.88>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</a>
<a NAME=1.2.89>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</a>
<a NAME=1.2.90>What is it that you would impart to me?</a>
<a NAME=1.2.91>If it be aught toward the general good,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.92>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.93>And I will look on both indifferently,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.94>For let the gods so speed me as I love</a>
<a NAME=1.2.95>The name of honour more than I fear death.</a>
</blockquote>
<a NAME=speech36><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a NAME=1.2.96>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.97>As well as I do know your outward favour.</a>
<a NAME=1.2.98>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</a>
<a NAME=1.2.99>I cannot tell what you and other men</a>
<a NAME=1.2.100>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.101>I had as lief not be as live to be</a>
<a NAME=1.2.102>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</a>
<a NAME=1.2.103>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</a>
<a NAME=1.2.104>We both have fed as well, and we can both</a>
<a NAME=1.2.105>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</a>
<a NAME=1.2.106>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.107>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.108>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</a>
<a NAME=1.2.109>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.110>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.111>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</a>
<a NAME=1.2.112>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</a>
<a NAME=1.2.113>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</a>
<a NAME=1.2.114>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</a>
<a NAME=1.2.115>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</a>
<a NAME=1.2.116>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.117>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</a>
<a NAME=1.2.118>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.119>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</a>
<a NAME=1.2.120>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</a>
<a NAME=1.2.121>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</a>
<a NAME=1.2.122>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</a>
<a NAME=1.2.123>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.124>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</a>
<a NAME=1.2.125>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.126>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</a>
<a NAME=1.2.127>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</a>
<a NAME=1.2.128>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.129>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</a>
<a NAME=1.2.130>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</a>
<a NAME=1.2.131>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</a>
<a NAME=1.2.132>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</a>
<a NAME=1.2.133>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</a>
<a NAME=1.2.134>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</a>
<a NAME=1.2.135>A man of such a feeble temper should</a>

<a NAME=1.2.144>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</a>

<a NAME=5.5.21>Two several times by night; at Sardis once,</a>
