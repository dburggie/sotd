<title>The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet</title>
<a name="speech0"><b>Chorus</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.0.1">Two households, both alike in dignity,</a>
<a name="1.0.2">In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</a>
<a name="1.0.3">From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</a>
<a name="1.0.4">Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</a>
<a name="1.0.5">From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</a>
<a name="1.0.6">A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</a>
<a name="1.0.7">Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</a>
<a name="1.0.8">Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</a>
<a name="1.0.9">The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</a>
<a name="1.0.10">And the continuance of their parents' rage,</a>
<a name="1.0.11">Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</a>
<a name="1.0.12">Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</a>
<a name="1.0.13">The which if you with patient ears attend,</a>
<a name="1.0.14">What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</a>

<a name="1.1.12">That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes</a>

<a name="speech11"><b>SAMPSON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<a name="1.1.14">True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,</a>
<a name="1.1.15">are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push</a>
<a name="1.1.16">Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids</a>

<a name="5.3.242">And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</a>
<a name="5.3.243">I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</a>
<a name="5.3.244">Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</a>
<a name="5.3.245">Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</a>
<a name="5.3.246">For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</a>
<a name="5.3.247">You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</a>
<a name="5.3.248">Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</a>
<a name="5.3.249">To County Paris: then comes she to me,</a>
<a name="5.3.250">And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</a>
<a name="5.3.251">To rid her from this second marriage,</a>
<a name="5.3.252">Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</a>
<a name="5.3.253">Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</a>
<a name="5.3.254">A sleeping potion; which so took effect</a>
<a name="5.3.255">As I intended, for it wrought on her</a>
<a name="5.3.256">The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</a>
<a name="5.3.257">That he should hither come as this dire night,</a>
<a name="5.3.258">To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</a>
<a name="5.3.259">Being the time the potion's force should cease.</a>
<a name="5.3.260">But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</a>
<a name="5.3.261">Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</a>
<a name="5.3.262">Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</a>
<a name="5.3.263">At the prefixed hour of her waking,</a>
<a name="5.3.264">Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</a>
<a name="5.3.265">Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</a>
<a name="5.3.266">Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</a>
<a name="5.3.267">But when I came, some minute ere the time</a>
<a name="5.3.268">Of her awaking, here untimely lay</a>
<a name="5.3.269">The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</a>
<a name="5.3.270">She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</a>
<a name="5.3.271">And bear this work of heaven with patience:</a>
<a name="5.3.272">But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</a>
<a name="5.3.273">And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</a>
<a name="5.3.274">But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</a>
<a name="5.3.275">All this I know; and to the marriage</a>
<a name="5.3.276">Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</a>
<a name="5.3.277">Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</a>
<a name="5.3.278">Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</a>
<a name="5.3.279">Unto the rigour of severest law.</a>
